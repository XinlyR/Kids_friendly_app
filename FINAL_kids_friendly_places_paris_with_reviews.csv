Each dish was flavorful and satisfying, making our dining experience truly enjoyable. ""The Family"" restaurant certainly lives up to its name, providing cozy and inviting atmosphere perfect for a family outing.; So I Google a place to have a reasonable steak, so many great reviews about this place and I need to add mine as well. The service was fantastic, spoken English, had an English menu on a chalkboard which is pretty awesome and check out this food in the pictures. I can see why people come back to this place for sure.

Reasonable price. Tasty food.

Feeling full and no room to order dessert.
Happy dinner in French!; The best linguine I have ever had.  The chorizo made it perfect. Fantastic service. Only in Paris three nights and ate there twice because it was so good. The rest of my family had the steak and they all raved about that too.",48.8735793,2.3347167,1er

The waiter is very friendly. Even though he can barely speak English but still tries to communicate as much as he can. The menu is very simple. You either choose 2 courses pairing the mains with entrees or dessert for 28 Euros or all 3 courses for 36 Euros. All the items in each course is written in French onto the chalkboard. So i presume it is changed regularly. Though I can't understand French,  its easily overcome with Google Lens . The entree of squid and chorizo sausages in an orange thick soup was a pleasant surprise. For the mains I tried beef tatare for the first time and it tastes good. Ended meal with a chocolate mousse with sea salt. The waiter was a one man show handling many tables so each course took some time to arrive which was understandable. Hope the restaurant can find some help soon for this kind gentleman :); Great casual spot.
Came for a Thursday night dinner. Service was very good and the staff is very nice. The place is quiet and chill and away of the street‚Äôs bustle.
Buratta and the apricot crumble were the highlight of the evening.
Beef fillet was also good, but nothing too exciting.; We were looking for a fine dine restaurant, this was recommended by our hotel staff, and surprisingly this was indeed a good experience. Price it's reasonable, portions are great, great service! The only improvement I see are the desserts, they are too heavy by my taste, but definitely does not affect overall experience.; The restaurant was an absolutely fantastic discovery having come here for dinner with a friend! We chose it judging by all the positive reviews & we weren't disappointed üòç Every dish that we ordered was absolutely exquisite!! We had the burrata as a starter, the dorade ceviche as a main and the seasonal crumble, as well S the mousse au chocolat for dessert - each and every one of them was a little wow experience ü§Ø The prices were fair for the outstanding quality - 27‚Ç¨ for a starter + a main dish or a main dish + a dessert; or 35‚Ç¨ for all the three courses. I had a white wine suggested which fit perfectly with the food and all in all, the service was so warm and welcoming, which is extremely refreshing in the world of grumpy Parisian waiters üòÖ The only thing to mention, is that it would be great to have some more qualitative tea instead of just Lipton in a tea bag üòè It's located in a little hidden street, so it's really calm & away from all the noise of the cars, while being super central, it's simply the perfect mix!!! We will be back for sure & I have already suggested it to other friends ‚ô•Ô∏è; It was a nice fixed price menu place. My favorites were the mushroom soup starter and the desserts. For my entr√©e I had the steak tartare, and I guess it's one of those things I can check off the list as having tried.

I really can't recommend this place enough. If you find yourself in Paris, go to Cafe Latin - you won't regret it!; We LOVED this place. Happened to stumble in and had an amazing experience.

The staff were super friendly and spoke fluent English.; I ordered a beef steak and was surprised when they brought a medium rare. By default in every restaurant I've ever been it's medium.

Medium rare is still smth that I eat but it was unevenly fried and a half of the steak was completely raw. Although I was very hungry raw is not what I can eat.

The waitress didn't even bother to ask why I didn't finish my steak. Overall she looked tired, unhappy and at the same time busy - she was the only one to serve all the tables. It wasn't a peak hour and only about third of the tables is not less were occupied.; Great place with great food. I had the sea bass and a huge portion of profiteroles for dessert. So good.
The place is heaving with people in the evening, it‚Äôs got a very youthful vibe and I like that.
Great selection of drinks too.; Awful service, the guy was rude to customers and slammed our glasses when serving them to us.
Not to mention when my friend asked for the bill he loudly said that he should go inside to pay while shaking his head.

The staff were nice and friendly. We got their sirloin steak with shallot cream and one with morel (mushroom) sauce, and duck breast. We also got the creme brulee, lemon tart and chocolate fondant with ice cream for dessert.; We loved everything here!
The service was great and we were greeted by a smile as soon as we arrived.

Food came out super quickly and was delicious. Great portion as well, so great value for money. Cocktails were tasty and refreshing for these hot summer afternoons.

Ambience was one of the things I liked the most. Soothing and relaxing, allowing for you to properly enjoy your food and take a breath, despite being located in a busy street.

100% recommend.; We decided to try this place out after seeing all the fantastic reviews, but upon arrival, we almost thought we were at the wrong place‚Äîit looked almost like a PMU from the outside! However, stepping inside changed our minds instantly. The interior is surprisingly cute, and it was bustling with energy during our Saturday brunch visit.

There's even a piano set up for their piano nights, adding a charming touch. The staff was incredibly friendly, which made our experience even better.
The food? Absolutely delightful. I had the foie gras and salade p√©rigourdine as starters, which were hearty enough to be mains, followed by the succulent souris d‚Äôagneau. The portions were generous across the board, definitely making it worth the money.

I would heartily recommend this spot and affirm that it truly deserves its high ratings, especially for the quality of the cuisine.; Amazing little gem. Very good food. Very nice staff and they helped me with my gastric bypass needs. Food was delicious steak was a little undercooked because I asked for medium rare but I got rare. No big problem was tasty nonetheless!; Alfredo is great! The dishes he recommended were surprisingly good. We ordered the lamb, goat cheese salad, charcuterie board, and French onion soup. To top off a great dinner he treated us to mint shots that we loved. Give this place a try!",48.8756486,2.343649000000001,1er

The origin story of the restaurant is featured in a spiral bound menu that was provided in addition to the fold-out brunch menu. The formule at 30 euros is a steal. In general, the restaurant offers great value for money. The egg/ham croissant was a 3 for me because of the scrambled egg quality (reminded me of cafeteria powdered eggs) and croissant quality (tough texture).

Since we came for only 3 days to Paris and did not want to go to the same place twice, we went to explore other places in the following g evening. We regret not coming back to have this lamb again.

The waiter is very friendly. Even though he can barely speak English but still tries to communicate as much as he can. The menu is very simple. You either choose 2 courses pairing the mains with entrees or dessert for 28 Euros or all 3 courses for 36 Euros. All the items in each course is written in French onto the chalkboard. So i presume it is changed regularly. Though I can't understand French,  its easily overcome with Google Lens . The entree of squid and chorizo sausages in an orange thick soup was a pleasant surprise. For the mains I tried beef tatare for the first time and it tastes good. Ended meal with a chocolate mousse with sea salt. The waiter was a one man show handling many tables so each course took some time to arrive which was understandable. Hope the restaurant can find some help soon for this kind gentleman :); Great casual spot.
Came for a Thursday night dinner. Service was very good and the staff is very nice. The place is quiet and chill and away of the street‚Äôs bustle.
Buratta and the apricot crumble were the highlight of the evening.
Beef fillet was also good, but nothing too exciting.; We were looking for a fine dine restaurant, this was recommended by our hotel staff, and surprisingly this was indeed a good experience. Price it's reasonable, portions are great, great service! The only improvement I see are the desserts, they are too heavy by my taste, but definitely does not affect overall experience.; The restaurant was an absolutely fantastic discovery having come here for dinner with a friend! We chose it judging by all the positive reviews & we weren't disappointed üòç Every dish that we ordered was absolutely exquisite!! We had the burrata as a starter, the dorade ceviche as a main and the seasonal crumble, as well S the mousse au chocolat for dessert - each and every one of them was a little wow experience ü§Ø The prices were fair for the outstanding quality - 27‚Ç¨ for a starter + a main dish or a main dish + a dessert; or 35‚Ç¨ for all the three courses. I had a white wine suggested which fit perfectly with the food and all in all, the service was so warm and welcoming, which is extremely refreshing in the world of grumpy Parisian waiters üòÖ The only thing to mention, is that it would be great to have some more qualitative tea instead of just Lipton in a tea bag üòè It's located in a little hidden street, so it's really calm & away from all the noise of the cars, while being super central, it's simply the perfect mix!!! We will be back for sure & I have already suggested it to other friends ‚ô•Ô∏è; It was a nice fixed price menu place. My favorites were the mushroom soup starter and the desserts. For my entr√©e I had the steak tartare, and I guess it's one of those things I can check off the list as having tried.

The staff were super friendly and spoke fluent English.; I ordered a beef steak and was surprised when they brought a medium rare. By default in every restaurant I've ever been it's medium.

Medium rare is still smth that I eat but it was unevenly fried and a half of the steak was completely raw. Although I was very hungry raw is not what I can eat.

The waitress didn't even bother to ask why I didn't finish my steak. Overall she looked tired, unhappy and at the same time busy - she was the only one to serve all the tables. It wasn't a peak hour and only about third of the tables is not less were occupied.; Great place with great food. I had the sea bass and a huge portion of profiteroles for dessert. So good.
The place is heaving with people in the evening, it‚Äôs got a very youthful vibe and I like that.
Great selection of drinks too.; Awful service, the guy was rude to customers and slammed our glasses when serving them to us.

What a great dining Atmosphere experience. if you‚Äôre in this area, don‚Äôt look any further.; Very kid and tourist friendly. The staff were so sweet, and the food was wonderful. I highly recommend their seafood ceviche. Dessert was to die for too. Their cr√®me br√ªl√©e was the table‚Äôs favorite.; My wife and I had our first dinner in this last visit to Paris. My wife is not a ‚Äúlamb food fan‚Äù, and had a steak, while I ordered the ‚Äú7 hour lamb dish‚Äù.
The food was great, cooked to order, and very tasty. Service was great too. With that said, I would like to emphasize the ‚Äú7 hour lamb‚Äù dish that was probably the best lamb dish I had so far. It was adobe style, super duper tasty. It was so good my wife ate more of it than her steak. Since we came for only 3 days to Paris and did not want to go to the same place twice, we went to explore other places in the following g evening. We regret not coming back to have this lamb again. Other dinners were fine too, but this was the most remembered from this trip. Served with spinach warm side dish and (what I believe was) mashed cilantro root. It is a MUST HAVE dish!",48.8632418,2.3511666,2e

The savoury ham, cheese and egg crepe was really crispy and savoury. I preferred the sweet crepe with ice cream and caramel more. It wasn't overly sweet. Everything went really well with the cider.

The restaurant is really compact and space is scarce to move around. The service is very good, attentive, helpful and prompt. The five stars are for the great service really and not so much for the food - I have had better. Reservations are required in advance as it gets busy. It seems overpriced to me.; Our second time in Les Enfants Rouges was interesting. Definitely reserve your table in advance, the place is packed. Cozy atmosphere. Staff is super nice.

Neither of the entries deserve a mention, thus 4 stars.; Definitely a 5-star and particularly at the reasonable price. Dishes from Les Enfants Rouge and chef-patron Da√Ø Shinozuka. He takes classic French ingredients and adds Japanese flair. Each dish worked well with balanced, nuanced flavours that excited the palate. The rum baba is the best in the world. With one bottle of wine, the cost was just under ‚Ç¨100 a head.
The first time we came was about ten years ago. Standards have not dropped and its popularity is understandable - so book in advance. Five stars! (And the service was good too.); A must stop by place if you‚Äôre in Paris. Modern French cuisine, with a Japanese twist. Everything was absolutely delicious, and the dishes were art pieces.

Great selection of drinks including Japanese cocktails and sake üëå; Blown away by the quality of the lunch course, especially compared to the price.

Highly recommend!; BEST CYBERCAFE in Paris. Games run smoothly and no FPS drop. One downside is Espot Paris doesn‚Äôt have Faceit Anti-Cheat so CS2 players have to play on the Valve server (boring and less competitive). Hope you guys can install the Anti-cheat ‚ù§Ô∏è; My son and I have been visiting e-sport cafes all throughout Europe on our holiday, big and small, and had high expectations for the capital of France to set the standard.

First impressions, it looks like a really slick set up. Consoles with big screens greet you in a darkened fluro paradise. We wanted 5 hours each and were quoted a price higher than their day package. I had to point this out to have it adjusted. Hmmmm.

Place uses a login in system to a set of backend client of games with no modification or ability to add additional titles. Make sure you get the spelling of your gamertag correct otherwise you will have login issues, but you can use this to get into any PC which is nice.

The PC dungeon downstairs looks impressive until you look closer. Basic Logitech keyboards, some with num keypads some without, some with worn out keys, some with backlights not working, basic 5 button mice. It's fine though, you can move to your station of preference.

We then tried to shift the in game language for Dota 2 to english as we have done in every other place we have visited. Normally modifying your steam language will suffice, but this time it also needed to be also completed in game which requires a client restart. Staff tried to help, but were told this was not possible. Being able to set a game to your native language is a basic requirement in my opinion. Very frustrating.

Then the crashes. Oh my, the crashes. About every hour a hard crash occurred for both PCs, requiring login again to steam and game relaunch (photo attached). In a ranked game MOBA like Dota 2 this can be punishing. To have it happen so frequently speaks to backend problems.

To wrap up, staff were friendly but ultimately unhelpful. Setup and decor looks cool with decent machines but they are a little worn out.
Cost is very expensive for what you get, which in our case was a dismal experience. We've tried little back alley cafes to massive dedicated e-sport establishments, and unfortunately this one has been the worst so far.

Plenty of others to try in Paris, give this one a miss.; Friendly staff, good value, lots of games.",48.86087819999999,2.3413395,2e

The pizza was excellent. My only complaint is that I didn't buy two! The cheese was tasty and stringy, like good mozzarella should be. The sauce was tangy without being overwhelming and the crust was light with the perfect taste of pizza oven. The thin crust was sufficient to hold the significant cheese and pepperoni topping. The pepperoni was crisp and delicious.

The pasta bolognese was great! There was a lot in that little container. The pasta was perfectly cooked, and the sauce was quite rich (and there was plenty of it). The sauce had quite a bit of meat in it and was very tasty.

Lastly, the cost was very reasonable. I would definitely recommend this place. Note that it's take out only, and there's no place to sit. Don't let that stop you. Great pizza and very friendly owner/staff.; Very tasty pizza and dessert. Excellent service and reasonably priced. Everything for the most part was homemade and fresh.

The design looked quite cool and the food was pretty good but we noticed a lot of mouse / rat droppings on the sofa and and on the counters which put us off a lot also the toilet wasn't nice and didn't have any soap which didn't help with the cleanliness feeling.; The breakfast menu consisting of a hot drink, croissant, and fresh orange juice was great. Especially the croissant that was just fresh out of the issue. While the cafe au lait was delicious, the peppermint tea consisted of fresh mint leaves and a bag of green tea. This wasn't great for people who order mint tea specifically because they don't enjoy green tea.; Had a lovely time here. Two friends and I ordered a menu (Formule) and they took a bit too long. They forgot my starter and brought it after the main dish which was messed up too; the steak was half-raw when I like it done.

People are incredibly nice, welcoming. The food, homemade, is really good and the meat was excellent. Although area is very touristic, it is the exception and it feels like a local restaurant. Every time we went, most customers were french people which is a great sign. The terrasse experience is really nice; The food was great. I had the veal steak with mashed potatoes and it was awesome. Kids had the beef steak and loved it. Honestly can‚Äôt remember my wife dish name but looked great!
The staff were super friendly and spoke fluent English.; I ordered a beef steak and was surprised when they brought a medium rare. By default in every restaurant I've ever been it's medium.

Medium rare is still smth that I eat but it was unevenly fried and a half of the steak was completely raw. Although I was very hungry raw is not what I can eat.

The waitress didn't even bother to ask why I didn't finish my steak. Overall she looked tired, unhappy and at the same time busy - she was the only one to serve all the tables. It wasn't a peak hour and only about third of the tables is not less were occupied.; Great place with great food. I had the sea bass and a huge portion of profiteroles for dessert. So good.
The place is heaving with people in the evening, it‚Äôs got a very youthful vibe and I like that.
Great selection of drinks too.; Awful service, the guy was rude to customers and slammed our glasses when serving them to us.
Not to mention when my friend asked for the bill he loudly said that he should go inside to pay while shaking his head.

Wandering the streets looking for a nice address, we found this cozy joint next to place des Vosges, with a sunday brunch menu !

My favourite was the bun with mozzarella and coppa di parma ; incredibly tasty
and the 3rd and most original was pupkin pancakes with cheese, topped with beets and salad !

Their juices were really good too ; I tried the refreshing apple, cucumber, lemon shake !

Nice galettes. Very fast service. The ingredients were fresh, I was surprised by the oregano (great touch on the recipe in my opinion). Maybe one note would be the butter amount, which as we all know can never be enough!
Okay, another note for possible improvement: the menu. The font isn‚Äôt really readable, in my view at least :)
Plus points for the sitting, spacious and not crammed (üëç) and the location‚Äîconvenient!
I would like to leave 5 stars to award the work and encourage the future improvements.

The staff were nice and friendly. We got their sirloin steak with shallot cream and one with morel (mushroom) sauce, and duck breast. We also got the creme brulee, lemon tart and chocolate fondant with ice cream for dessert.; We loved everything here!
The service was great and we were greeted by a smile as soon as we arrived.

Food came out super quickly and was delicious. Great portion as well, so great value for money. Cocktails were tasty and refreshing for these hot summer afternoons.

Ambience was one of the things I liked the most. Soothing and relaxing, allowing for you to properly enjoy your food and take a breath, despite being located in a busy street.

100% recommend.; We decided to try this place out after seeing all the fantastic reviews, but upon arrival, we almost thought we were at the wrong place‚Äîit looked almost like a PMU from the outside! However, stepping inside changed our minds instantly. The interior is surprisingly cute, and it was bustling with energy during our Saturday brunch visit.

There's even a piano set up for their piano nights, adding a charming touch. The staff was incredibly friendly, which made our experience even better.
The food? Absolutely delightful. I had the foie gras and salade p√©rigourdine as starters, which were hearty enough to be mains, followed by the succulent souris d‚Äôagneau. The portions were generous across the board, definitely making it worth the money.

I would heartily recommend this spot and affirm that it truly deserves its high ratings, especially for the quality of the cuisine.; Amazing little gem. Very good food. Very nice staff and they helped me with my gastric bypass needs. Food was delicious steak was a little undercooked because I asked for medium rare but I got rare. No big problem was tasty nonetheless!; Alfredo is great! The dishes he recommended were surprisingly good. We ordered the lamb, goat cheese salad, charcuterie board, and French onion soup.

The origin story of the restaurant is featured in a spiral bound menu that was provided in addition to the fold-out brunch menu. The formule at 30 euros is a steal. In general, the restaurant offers great value for money. The egg/ham croissant was a 3 for me because of the scrambled egg quality (reminded me of cafeteria powdered eggs) and croissant quality (tough texture). The service is a 3 because the order had to be reconfirmed a few minutes after our drinks were served AND one of our drinks was served ‚Äúvirgin‚Äù in error.

Service was not great for our visit, cocktail forgotten, and a 45 minute wait for the main dish after starters.

The food was great, cooked to order, and very tasty. Service was great too. With that said, I would like to emphasize the ‚Äú7 hour lamb‚Äù dish that was probably the best lamb dish I had so far. It was adobe style, super duper tasty. It was so good my wife ate more of it than her steak. Since we came for only 3 days to Paris and did not want to go to the same place twice, we went to explore other places in the following g evening. We regret not coming back to have this lamb again. Other dinners were fine too, but this was the most remembered from this trip. Served with spinach warm side dish and (what I believe was) mashed cilantro root.

Medium rare is still smth that I eat but it was unevenly fried and a half of the steak was completely raw. Although I was very hungry raw is not what I can eat.

The service here is VERY nice. A lot of regulars come here and you can see the love and care that the owner has put into maintaining her relationships. Would recommend for crepes.",48.8532158,2.3379429,4e

EXCELLENT ! EXCELLENT ! EXCELLENT !
Wandering the streets looking for a nice address, we found this cozy joint next to place des Vosges, with a sunday brunch menu !
Very nice and not-cramped restaurant, few tables with spacious seating, wood decor, simple and heartwarming !
The owner (Diego) is a super friendly Italian from Parma, he handles the bar, his wife is the kitchen boss (super friendly as well, graced me with the honour of best client of the week ;)
We tried the 3 brunch main courses, and they were all 3 DELICIOUS !
Eggs with salmon, potato galette with cream cheese.
My favourite was the bun with mozzarella and coppa di parma ; incredibly tasty
and the 3rd and most original was pupkin pancakes with cheese, topped with beets and salad !
Simple, tasty, and copious !
Their juices were really good too ; I tried the refreshing apple, cucumber, lemon shake !
A must try address, e !ven if to grab a simple coffee.; A lovely place. We stumbled upon it for lunch and for 23 EUR had a 3 course menu with generous portions. The food is delicious and the staff lovely. The place is also nicely decorated and definitely worth a visit :)",48.8559262,2.3670624,4e

I would stay away from the heuvis rancheros, the tortilla was impossible to cut through.; I don't get homesick as much as many American expats, but I have to admit this place rang some nice bells for me. High-quality American diner cooking, which I sometimes still crave.

Hamburgers without pretense, milkshakes that taste like real milkshakes, and much better fries than I'm accustomed to in Paris.

The service is very friendly, bordering on jovial.

Hope you guys can install the Anti-cheat ‚ù§Ô∏è; My son and I have been visiting e-sport cafes all throughout Europe on our holiday, big and small, and had high expectations for the capital of France to set the standard.

First impressions, it looks like a really slick set up. Consoles with big screens greet you in a darkened fluro paradise. We wanted 5 hours each and were quoted a price higher than their day package. I had to point this out to have it adjusted. Hmmmm.

Place uses a login in system to a set of backend client of games with no modification or ability to add additional titles. Make sure you get the spelling of your gamertag correct otherwise you will have login issues, but you can use this to get into any PC which is nice.

The PC dungeon downstairs looks impressive until you look closer. Basic Logitech keyboards, some with num keypads some without, some with worn out keys, some with backlights not working, basic 5 button mice. It's fine though, you can move to your station of preference.

We then tried to shift the in game language for Dota 2 to english as we have done in every other place we have visited. Normally modifying your steam language will suffice, but this time it also needed to be also completed in game which requires a client restart. Staff tried to help, but were told this was not possible. Being able to set a game to your native language is a basic requirement in my opinion. Very frustrating.

Then the crashes. Oh my, the crashes. About every hour a hard crash occurred for both PCs, requiring login again to steam and game relaunch (photo attached). In a ranked game MOBA like Dota 2 this can be punishing. To have it happen so frequently speaks to backend problems.

To wrap up, staff were friendly but ultimately unhelpful. Setup and decor looks cool with decent machines but they are a little worn out.
Cost is very expensive for what you get, which in our case was a dismal experience. We've tried little back alley cafes to massive dedicated e-sport establishments, and unfortunately this one has been the worst so far.

The staff was super nice and the restaurant had a great feel and theme. The food was good but maybe not great though I think it might be a difference in the steak I grew up with vs here. Basically it's chewy and has been like this at multiple places. I'm betting that France has better laws on how cattle should be treated and better for cows may not equal more tender meat.

Anyway, I still loved the restaurant and would enjoy going back and trying other foods.; The brunch was quite enjoyable and priced at 35 euros. The food was delightful, and the ambiance was perfect.

To finish, the creme br√ªl√©e was ok but too much sugar on top or they didn‚Äôt take the time to burn it all and ended up with big pieces of raw sugar in the mouth.

The service was excellent too! The food comes so fast and the servers are attentive and very helpful. As an aside, I went around 10:30am when they opened and there was plenty of space and no wait at all.
Breizh Caf√© definitely just became my go to recommendation for crepes and cider in Paris.; Excellent cr√™pes. The staff were friendly and attentive and the food came out very fast. The line moves fast as well despite peak hour. Recommend the tofu and avocado galette - very unique!; Was happy to find that their galette (buckwheat crepes) is gluten free so that my husband could enjoy them. We went around 7, which is the early side of dinner for France and were able to be seated immediately at an outside table even though they were already busy. The downside to Europe is that smoking is allowed outside so we had to put up with that a few times during our meal.

The galettes were yummy and we both ordered dessert too. My dessert was a crepe (made with wheat flour) which I thought was a little more tender than the buckwheat.

The place was packed so the servers were occupied all the time. We got our orders in and received food promptly but it took a little while to get our check once we were done because they were so busy. I know this is a chain but I'd recommend them for a nice casual meal.; My wife and I were so looking forward to returning here having enjoyed this place on two earlier visits.  Granted it‚Äôs been five years since our last visit, but this was so disappointing.  Evidently this place has gone from one quaint location with an extraordinary Parisian crepe menu to a multi-location chain that somehow thinks Japanese and Brittany taste‚Äôs create some kind of great crepe fusion.  Wrong.  Just awful.  Progress in this case has not been progress I‚Äôm sorry to say.; The gazettes were delicious. Had a lil miscommunication with the staff but it were resolved eventually.

People are incredibly nice, welcoming. The food, homemade, is really good and the meat was excellent. Although area is very touristic, it is the exception and it feels like a local restaurant. Every time we went, most customers were french people which is a great sign. The terrasse experience is really nice; The food was great. I had the veal steak with mashed potatoes and it was awesome. Kids had the beef steak and loved it. Honestly can‚Äôt remember my wife dish name but looked great!
The staff were super friendly and spoke fluent English.; I ordered a beef steak and was surprised when they brought a medium rare. By default in every restaurant I've ever been it's medium.

Medium rare is still smth that I eat but it was unevenly fried and a half of the steak was completely raw. Although I was very hungry raw is not what I can eat.

The waitress didn't even bother to ask why I didn't finish my steak. Overall she looked tired, unhappy and at the same time busy - she was the only one to serve all the tables. It wasn't a peak hour and only about third of the tables is not less were occupied.; Great place with great food. I had the sea bass and a huge portion of profiteroles for dessert. So good.
The place is heaving with people in the evening, it‚Äôs got a very youthful vibe and I like that.
Great selection of drinks too.; Awful service, the guy was rude to customers and slammed our glasses when serving them to us.
Not to mention when my friend asked for the bill he loudly said that he should go inside to pay while shaking his head.
Do not recommend unless you‚Äôre a big fan of cheese and rude people.",48.8593182,2.3517222,5e

Wandering the streets looking for a nice address, we found this cozy joint next to place des Vosges, with a sunday brunch menu !
Very nice and not-cramped restaurant, few tables with spacious seating, wood decor, simple and heartwarming !

We tried the 3 brunch main courses, and they were all 3 DELICIOUS !
Eggs with salmon, potato galette with cream cheese.
My favourite was the bun with mozzarella and coppa di parma ; incredibly tasty
and the 3rd and most original was pupkin pancakes with cheese, topped with beets and salad !
Simple, tasty, and copious !
Their juices were really good too ; I tried the refreshing apple, cucumber, lemon shake !

It feels like they are charging as much as a normal portion but giving you kids portions. The food wasn‚Äôt even that good or that bad it‚Äôs just not really what you‚Äôre expecting with the menu, the prices and the American style.

I would stay away from the heuvis rancheros, the tortilla was impossible to cut through.; I don't get homesick as much as many American expats, but I have to admit this place rang some nice bells for me. High-quality American diner cooking, which I sometimes still crave.

Hamburgers without pretense, milkshakes that taste like real milkshakes, and much better fries than I'm accustomed to in Paris.

The service is very friendly, bordering on jovial.

All around, a solid spot.",48.8421104,2.335263,5e

Highly recommend egg mayonnaise and goat cheese salad as starter, followed by steak tartar and a hamburger.

Better to make a reservation, because it was full when we arrived and the owner was kind enough to helping us find a table outside.; The Cheddar Burger is next level, clocked medium rare just perfect! We tried also the Hungarian Tartar and was delicious, people and atmosphere are super nice! 5*; Stumbled on this place by accident on the Internet.  I nooked it as was more towards East of city so great place to stop if going in city from Disney.  Its kinda out of town, and we parked nearby. I was a little nervous that we would be the only people on a Tuesday evening, but when I got in there, it was fully booked.
It's super casual but awesome food. My wife and I shared a burger and a salmon tarta, and kids had burgers. The cheff clearly had a love for cheese, and developing tastes at the food was fantastic.  If you want fine dining, this is not for you, but great burgers and food in a casual atmosphere is for you.  The staff are super cool and speak English.  Book, and loads of nearby parking...
My photos are rubbish, but the ones on their website are a true reflection; My absolute favorite tartare place in Paris! Went there twice in June 2024. Had different tartare creations. Both were really nice. The meat was so fresh. Would keep coming back every time I visit Paris. The service was great. The staff were cool.; Many images already but here you have another one of the Roman. It was very good but what stood out for me were the atmosphere and service. The guys were so casual, helpful and fast in delivering our food. Very very good value for the money, can‚Äôt wait to come back.

The products don't exactly match the UK ones 100%, but I shouldn't have expected that anyway. The food was good and full of calories ‚Äî as it should be! ;) The burger and desserts were also nice, and the restaurant has a great American vibe. If that's what you like, you should definitely visit.; Potatoes were crispy, eggs scrambled perfectly, the banana french toast was delicioussss. Much needed breakfast satisfaction.; We went to a small, charming breakfast place with our baby. The staff was polite, friendly, and helpful. However, the prices were a bit high for some items. We had asked for coffee, and they brought it with milk. They also refilled the second cup for free. I think it was a nice gesture of good service to refill the coffee twice.; A small but very welcoming place to have American dinner.
A very fluke that our waiter forgot my milk for my coffee but totally understandable as the place was really busy and he was on his own I believe.
Overall our family would highly recommend this place if your looking for  English speaking breakfast and have a usual American breakfast; Good restaurant overall. Server was very nice and polite.

We went savory this time with ham and cheese, they were super generous with the filling. Thing with it having tomatoes though is the bottom gets a bit soggy. Nonetheless a very enjoyable and filling midnight snack.; Great crepe, I tried banana and nutella crepe. Really yummy üòã
Then I went ahead and had one more, dark chocolate with coconut. Equally good. I also had a coffee shot to have a good combination of sweet and bitter.; This is the most surprisingly tasty and filling meal. I went twice in one day because it was so good! Best food!! Wish I could go back it was that great. The chef crepe was my favorite. The Nutella banana was also great; We came to Paris for 6 days and we came to Nicos on our second day here. We came back today because the first time was that good (and we might be coming back tomorrow for lunch as well üòÇ). This time was even better.

Unfortunately, the dishes were nothing to write home about.

Good thing is that the food came very fast. Slightly disappointing also is that, arriving at 7pm and leaving at 8.30pm the restaurant was still relatively empty (30-40% occupancy only).  That was a Wednesday evening. Is it a good or a bad sign?; I got salmon pasta, goat cheese, French cola and coffee. I paid 31 euros total.

The downside to Europe is that smoking is allowed outside so we had to put up with that a few times during our meal.

The galettes were yummy and we both ordered dessert too. My dessert was a crepe (made with wheat flour) which I thought was a little more tender than the buckwheat.

The place was packed so the servers were occupied all the time. We got our orders in and received food promptly but it took a little while to get our check once we were done because they were so busy.

Medium rare is still smth that I eat but it was unevenly fried and a half of the steak was completely raw. Although I was very hungry raw is not what I can eat.

The staff is super friendly and kind. The latte was delicious, and so were my pancakes! They reminded me of American pancakes, which are not easy to find in Paris. I definitely recommend. I can‚Äôt wait to go back and try more things on the menu!; We ate here recently for breakfast. It's a really cute caf√© in a very quiet street. My friend and I ordered pancakes, I ordered also the a√ßai bowl. The food was absolutely delicious, and the only fault I had was that the pancakes are so small and unfortunately not filling at all. They were great though but definitely need at least 50% more. The staff are very nice and attentive. The plates were beautifully presented. The coffee is exceptional here, my new favourite caf√© for coffee. Highly recommend this place.; I recently tried the passion fruit iced tea at this caf√©, and it was fantastic. Refreshing and full of flavor, it was the perfect drink for a warm day. The caf√©'s setting by the Seine and next to Notre-Dame makes it even more enjoyable. The beautiful surroundings add to the relaxing atmosphere. Highly recommend giving it a try!; One of the first places I visit when I arrive to my first visit to Paris. I needed to work something in my computer and it was great the atmosphere, very wholesome. It has an area for kids to read. The owners were so nice and welcoming. The coffee and the chocolate chip cookies were great (I am a fan of üç™). If I ever go back I will like to visit once again. I wish the best to this caf√©.; Really cute & lovely coffee shop! Loved the staff there, really nice! In terms of food, we took a carrot cake, a black sesame latte & mango&pineapple smoothie. Everything was really good! I would love to come back and try the other things there. In terms of space, there are not a lot of tables so it can be easily packed, not suitable for big groups. I would recommend coming there! ++ for the lovely menu which was probably handmade and then printed.",48.850106,2.3504724,6e

It wasn't full when we arrived but after we sat down the place started to fill up with people. We ordered the crepe with ham, cheese and egg and the crepe little Breizh crepe as well as a cider. You can't have crepes without cider in France.
The savoury ham, cheese and egg crepe was really crispy and savoury. I preferred the sweet crepe with ice cream and caramel more. It wasn't overly sweet. Everything went really well with the cider.
The service here is VERY nice. A lot of regulars come here and you can see the love and care that the owner has put into maintaining her relationships. Would recommend for crepes.",48.8532158,2.3379429,6e

The chicken was amazing, and worth sharing. The happy hour on cocktails was a good deal as well, and delicious cocktails.

Service was not great for our visit, cocktail forgotten, and a 45 minute wait for the main dish after starters. We noticed several other tables having quite some issues with service as well around us. It was not busy or full at the time. A great dining experience turned poor by long waits and off service.

That said, not so bad I wouldn‚Äôt try again, it could be an off day, but the food was great, and service was friendly despite the waits and inattentiveness.; This place was absolutely wonderful!

I highly recommend their seafood ceviche. Dessert was to die for too. Their cr√®me br√ªl√©e was the table‚Äôs favorite.; My wife and I had our first dinner in this last visit to Paris. My wife is not a ‚Äúlamb food fan‚Äù, and had a steak, while I ordered the ‚Äú7 hour lamb dish‚Äù.
The food was great, cooked to order, and very tasty. Service was great too. With that said, I would like to emphasize the ‚Äú7 hour lamb‚Äù dish that was probably the best lamb dish I had so far. It was adobe style, super duper tasty. It was so good my wife ate more of it than her steak. Since we came for only 3 days to Paris and did not want to go to the same place twice, we went to explore other places in the following g evening. We regret not coming back to have this lamb again. Other dinners were fine too, but this was the most remembered from this trip. Served with spinach warm side dish and (what I believe was) mashed cilantro root.

I would stay away from the heuvis rancheros, the tortilla was impossible to cut through.; I don't get homesick as much as many American expats, but I have to admit this place rang some nice bells for me. High-quality American diner cooking, which I sometimes still crave.

Hamburgers without pretense, milkshakes that taste like real milkshakes, and much better fries than I'm accustomed to in Paris.

However, the value you get for the amount spent ie bang for your buck, isn‚Äôt satisfactory.

French toast was basic, borderline bland. Decent texture but flavor wasn‚Äôt heightened. Appreciate the swiftness of orders though as I asked the staff for a quick bite as I was in between meetings.

Staff needs to be trained more to be honest. The eagerness is there so they have the right mindset but I couldn‚Äôt tell there was a leader or master orchestrator of operations ergo affecting efficiency in timing and delivery of orders.; It‚Äôs a beautiful small place with charming interior. However, service isn‚Äôt organized enough. They served people who came after us before they served us and they took forever for any request even a glass of water!! Also the staff aren‚Äôt welcoming at all. When it comes to the food, it wasn‚Äôt tasty nor fresh. The french toast was like soaked in oil since the last night or reheated. It was hard and dry from inside. Omelette was ok not the best. Cappuccino was the only delicious order.
Also, it‚Äôs a small cafe so most of the tables are pretty closed to each others with no privacy, you‚Äôre like sitting with the next table and they‚Äôre sitting with you as well!!; Beautiful spot for breakfast/brunch. Reservations are not required though, to avoid waiting, it‚Äôs recommended to come right when they open.

-Avocado Toast
- French Toast; Fun place to grab a bite to eat or drink!

Food was pretty good, the steak tartare offered better value than the petit filet, which lived up to its billing.  Chips and salad good.  Service was efficient.; Awesome place with great food and pretty much the only place with good service we experienced in 3 days in paris. Chich and trendy decor, nested in a cute arcade between the Dior and Chanel store, Well thought out and presented dishes, encompassing a range of tastes and flavours from around the world. They were also very accommodating with our 4 year old and made a dish for her that wasn't on the menu. Not cheap but it is what it is.; Place is nice but the food was terrible and expensive, 12‚Ç¨ for a plate of scrambled eggs that appeared to be soup with a small bread that was hard as a rock, the coffee was worst than instant coffee and it came from a machine not from an espresso machine which for 8‚Ç¨ is a scam.

The service is ok, nothing surprising just regular Paris service.

The place is in a nice spot but definitely not worth the price, you pay top money and get low quality.; Tucked in an alley next to Dior. Freshest seafood I‚Äôve had in Paris and this place has outdoor seating and indoor seating. We had Thai salad with prawns very fresh. We also had Brunch with smoked salmon with avocado salad also very fresh with the fluffiest scrambled eggs. The menu is simple with other salad options, rigatoni, artichoke salad, tuna tartare, beef tartare, club sandwich (looks yummy) and desserts. Service is professional and friendly.

I would stay away from the heuvis rancheros, the tortilla was impossible to cut through.; I don't get homesick as much as many American expats, but I have to admit this place rang some nice bells for me. High-quality American diner cooking, which I sometimes still crave.

Hamburgers without pretense, milkshakes that taste like real milkshakes, and much better fries than I'm accustomed to in Paris.

The menu was available online in English which was greatly appreciated. Food was excellent and the staff even went a little more than needed with service. I Enjoyed three courses and would happily eat here again.; Great place, amazing service, cute interior, very good food. We had the Eggs Benedict with Cheddar and Ham (‚Ç¨15) and it‚Äôs just like you‚Äôd wish them. They have full brunch menu for ‚Ç¨25 with drinks included. There‚Äôs space for improvement for the Home Made Iced Tea, though. The taste is very faded, basically flavoured water and does not correspond to the price (‚Ç¨5). Still this place gets 5 stars from me for everything else.; Went on a Sunday morning for a buffet.

The waiter is very friendly. Even though he can barely speak English but still tries to communicate as much as he can. The menu is very simple.

So i presume it is changed regularly. Though I can't understand French,  its easily overcome with Google Lens . The entree of squid and chorizo sausages in an orange thick soup was a pleasant surprise. For the mains I tried beef tatare for the first time and it tastes good. Ended meal with a chocolate mousse with sea salt. The waiter was a one man show handling many tables so each course took some time to arrive which was understandable. Hope the restaurant can find some help soon for this kind gentleman :); Great casual spot.

There's even a piano set up for their piano nights, adding a charming touch. The staff was incredibly friendly, which made our experience even better.
The food? Absolutely delightful. I had the foie gras and salade p√©rigourdine as starters, which were hearty enough to be mains, followed by the succulent souris d‚Äôagneau. The portions were generous across the board, definitely making it worth the money.

I would heartily recommend this spot and affirm that it truly deserves its high ratings, especially for the quality of the cuisine.; Amazing little gem. Very good food.

In general, the restaurant offers great value for money. The egg/ham croissant was a 3 for me because of the scrambled egg quality (reminded me of cafeteria powdered eggs) and croissant quality (tough texture).

Unfortunately i will not take the chance to go back...; We are a family of 5 from the US.  We went for an all-you-can-eat brunch on the weekend.

The vibe is v. family friendly and local.  We arrived early.  The dining space filled up pretty quickly, and included a mix of families and groups of adults.  Aside from us, the clientele was all locals.

The food was great.  It included a large variety of dishes, so you're sure to find something you like.  On the day we went, there was poached and smoked salmon, mussels, a couple of chicken dishes, and a large roast beef.  In addition, there were homemade country style cold-cuts, pickled vegetables, and cheese (the cheeses were great!).  There were a lot of vegetable dishes, including a potato cheese gratin that was the best I've ever had.  The kind of thing you just can't stop eating.  To round things out, there was a fresh fruit and desert table.  I had some apple tarte, a crepe and an excellent double-expresso.

We were there for an a bit more than an hour.  The staff was great, v. friendly and helpful.  The bathroom was clean.  It's too bad we only found this place at the end of our trip, we would definitely have come again.; Pretty nice and the staff is super nice!

Thanks to our guide Dominique we didn‚Äôt wait in lines, we learned so much and the kids have a very positive association with art and museums.; Amazing experience! We had Maeva as our guide and she was fantastic. We all learned so much, but my 7 year old was really excited to learn about the Mona Lisa. We went though most of the areas, played some scavenger hut games, and other interactive ways to learn about the history and art. Maeva made it fun and relatable for her, but actually we all learned so much. I wised I had another tour just to see more of the thousands of exhibits. It was absolutely worth the extra cost! Highly recommend!; We booked our tour to the Louvre very last minute and Lara had tickets available so it tells you the kind of organisation they are. Lara coordinated and accommodated anything we needed and then assigned us to Stephanie on the day who was just brilliant! Has inmense knowledge and anecdotes to keep us and especially our 8 year old thoroughly engaged. Last but not the least the skip the lines were incredibly beneficial! Just fantastic!!; Amazing experience, I was initially nervous about our visit to the Louvre with 3 kids, but the visit visit guided by Agathe exceeded our expectations! Thank you so much for making our girls enjoy a 3 hours tour, through fun facts and games to keep them interested! I highly recommend families to enjoy the Paris tours with kids!; We loved our tours with Dominique! She was amazing with kids. Our kids were a little young (6 and 4) for the places we went---Versailles and Musee d'Orsay--but Dominique was so patient, was willing to crouch down to talk at their level (literally), etc. She moved us along at the pace we needed, which was sometimes slow (needing to stop to have a snack) and sometimes brisk when my 4 year old was nearing the end of her attention span.

I was also peaking at the tables by me and the burrata avocado tomato salad also looked great, and the frites looked home made and home style with skins and plenty of dark bits on the edges.",48.8877748,2.3764664,10e

The 25‚Ç¨ brunch is well worth it. Incredible value. I had the house lemonade, a latt√©, the avocado tartine, the overnight porridge (a lovely delicate mixture of soaked oats, chia seed and fresh fruit), and a slice of apple caramel cake to finish. The cake was the highlight, though everything was delish. The waitress told me that everything is handmade, and you can definitely taste that in the food.; So delicious - the flavors of the avocado toast with sesame sprinkle all over!! And the pesto was incredible. The eggs - boiled on top of the toast or salad - very fresh and yummy!! We loved the waffle with fruit and enjoyed the juices - Fresh squeezed Ginger, Carrot, Lemon. Apple, Ginger, Lemon..and more!!! Great prices and super friendly staff.; Great carrot cake.
Coffee, really not good at all. I had a coffee earlier the day at the excellent Casa (specialty coffee Paris XII).
Well, the contrast was sad.

Also we waited about ten minutes with few clients for our drinks and the waitress mixed up the cakes also.

Improve the coffee and service and you'll improve your rating.; The best brunch I‚Äôve ever had! Ok, to be honest, I haven‚Äôt had many brunches in my life so far‚Ä¶ and it was my first time in Paris as well. But it was so delicious I don‚Äôt know if anything can be better‚Ä¶ freshly squeezed orange juice - great taste, not acidic, superb pro matcha, overnight porridge I never thought could be so special, extraordinary avocado toast (of those I‚Äôve had quite a lot, so trust me that this one was top notch), and waffle, the waffle!!! with salted caramel‚Ä¶ oh my mouth, stomach, eyes, everything, so happy, super full for 25‚Ç¨‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt eat until dinner‚Ä¶ Merci!!! I need to learn French!; Small but lovely place. Very nice service, great selection of food, coffee and tea. Coffee comes with a choice of plant-based milk if you prefer a vegan option.

We had the chai and coffee latte, and a granola, which was awesome. The bowls and toasts looked awesome, too.

The steak was rubbery, the salad was manky and the small glass of red was ‚Ç¨7. A real tourist trap! I shouldn't have entered when I saw the place completely empty!
Serves me right for placing my trust in these reviews!; Our first dinner experience in Paris and it was wonderful. The gentleman that was front of house was so nice and helpful. Food itself was also wonderful, cook on the beef was absolutely perfect.; The food is  very good and familiar.

The chicken was amazing, and worth sharing. The happy hour on cocktails was a good deal as well, and delicious cocktails.

Service was not great for our visit, cocktail forgotten, and a 45 minute wait for the main dish after starters. We noticed several other tables having quite some issues with service as well around us. It was not busy or full at the time. A great dining experience turned poor by long waits and off service.

That said, not so bad I wouldn‚Äôt try again, it could be an off day, but the food was great, and service was friendly despite the waits and inattentiveness.; This place was absolutely wonderful! Our waitress, Amelie, was incredibly kind and attentive, making our experience truly exceptional.

My wife is not a ‚Äúlamb food fan‚Äù, and had a steak, while I ordered the ‚Äú7 hour lamb dish‚Äù.
The food was great, cooked to order, and very tasty. Service was great too. With that said, I would like to emphasize the ‚Äú7 hour lamb‚Äù dish that was probably the best lamb dish I had so far. It was adobe style, super duper tasty. It was so good my wife ate more of it than her steak. Since we came for only 3 days to Paris and did not want to go to the same place twice, we went to explore other places in the following g evening. We regret not coming back to have this lamb again. Other dinners were fine too, but this was the most remembered from this trip. Served with spinach warm side dish and (what I believe was) mashed cilantro root.

The cafe is a short distance from Gare du Nord, has a great view of the Church and is popular with Parisiens. The waiter was very attentive and took our orders, even in our school level French.

The staff was super nice and the restaurant had a great feel and theme. The food was good but maybe not great though I think it might be a difference in the steak I grew up with vs here. Basically it's chewy and has been like this at multiple places. I'm betting that France has better laws on how cattle should be treated and better for cows may not equal more tender meat.

Anyway, I still loved the restaurant and would enjoy going back and trying other foods.; The brunch was quite enjoyable and priced at 35 euros. The food was delightful, and the ambiance was perfect. The restaurant wasn't overly crowded or noisy. We chose to sit outside, which was a lovely decision, making our Sunday very relaxing. However, the waiting time was a tad excessive. I'm not sure of the reason, but we waited for over 30 minutes for our food to arrive; Was all in all a pleasant except one of the dishes I was served gave me food poisoning and made me violently ill. I ordered sea bream carpaccio to start which did not taste fresh and scallop risotto for main which was pleasant. Around 20 minutes after the meal I become very unwell and was stuck in my bed for 2 days; Yes, the pictures look good but the food itself is horrible! I had so much high expectations for this place from the pictures I previously saw but ended up being disappointing. The food looks old and not fresh, tried the poulpe salad, not good, the octopus didn‚Äôt look fresh and the salad itself was not tasty. Next, the fish fillet with vegetables, the fish was ok but some vegetables went bad and had to spit it out as I didn‚Äôt want to end up with a food intoxication. To finish, the creme br√ªl√©e was ok but too much sugar on top or they didn‚Äôt take the time to burn it all and ended up with big pieces of raw sugar in the mouth. The staff was lovely and the space is really nice. It‚Äôs such a waste to serve such poor quality food in such a beautiful space. I would seriously invest in finding a better chef or whoever is responsible of the menu !; Went for my birthday as a surprise! And the Sunday brunch was absolutely amazing - the freshest seasonal vegetables, fish, the lemon cake - oh my! I also had some white wine - Chablis and tried their fois gras. Everything was  excellent presented and tasted great. Our waiter was very kind and spoke bothe French and English.

It was a cold night so we chose to sit inside, but many parties were sitting outside.

My goodness! I melted after the first bite of the ""Brioche perdue"". It was so light and bursting with subtle sweet flavors. Honey said her crepe was light, good mixture of fluffy and crispy, and the honey was a perfect addition of sweetness.

I had salmon in a crispy pastry with beautifully cooked vegetables in a sumptuous sauce and a medium rare beef dish with excellent fries and salad. The white wine and rose were wonderful too.

We had french fries and mousse au chocolat which was delicious but contained a little bit of lumps.
But we would definetely come back.; Delicious burgers. Close to the Jardin de Plants. The restaurant is on the corner of a street and easy to miss if you're coming from the north side.

The food (in my opinion) is good but did not blow my mind nor did I have a gastronomical experience. Its just one of those places that gets popular I guess. The restaurant is really compact and space is scarce to move around. The service is very good, attentive, helpful and prompt. The five stars are for the great service really and not so much for the food - I have had better. Reservations are required in advance as it gets busy. It seems overpriced to me.; Our second time in Les Enfants Rouges was interesting. Definitely reserve your table in advance, the place is packed. Cozy atmosphere. Staff is super nice. Best dish-desert. Both Pavlova and Cheese cake were superb. Lamb chops were delicious. Neither of the entries deserve a mention, thus 4 stars.; Definitely a 5-star and particularly at the reasonable price. Dishes from Les Enfants Rouge and chef-patron Da√Ø Shinozuka. He takes classic French ingredients and adds Japanese flair. Each dish worked well with balanced, nuanced flavours that excited the palate. The rum baba is the best in the world. With one bottle of wine, the cost was just under ‚Ç¨100 a head.
The first time we came was about ten years ago. Standards have not dropped and its popularity is understandable - so book in advance. Five stars! (And the service was good too.); A must stop by place if you‚Äôre in Paris. Modern French cuisine, with a Japanese twist. Everything was absolutely delicious, and the dishes were art pieces. Very friendly staff and cozy atmosphere. Reservation recommended! Great selection of drinks including Japanese cocktails and sake üëå; Blown away by the quality of the lunch course, especially compared to the price.

First impression at the door was horrible, security guy seemingly forgot that it‚Äôs not a nightclub. Once in you need to pay in advance, then if you want something extra (second glass of juice etc) you need to pay again on the spot. That seems redundant.

Staff is nice and welcoming, food was great and lots of different foods were available. Strong point: entertainment for children is available and included and they‚Äôre supervised.

The building is aging and many things are neglected it seems (toilet seat broken, doors to electrical safety equipment left open, spiderwebs everywhere and some chairs visibly not in good condition - also some ‚Äûblack mystery dust‚Äú on the napkins). Parking is difficult on the weekends due to the closure of the park, toilets are not stroller - wheelchair accessible.

For the price it must be better I think, the food can only make up for so much and then some.; Beautiful park area. The building is a little need of some upkeep. I went to attend a new years eve event. The meal was just OK, and the service quite slow, even by relaxed Paris standards. I noted that a large group seated almost 30 minutes after me were served their full course first. They may have been thinly staffed that night, but it seemed off.; A very scenic spot to host any event. The fees for depositing is slightly elevated but overall the service is on par.; Very lame Club! We were here at Silvester Party.

They pushed my friend as if he were a garbage bag while checking him. Even though we had biught tickets in advance for about 50‚Ç¨/person - they wanted to froce us to buy bottles so they can let us in. After i complained and showed them their website, another bouncer came and told them that i am right and the were wrong.
Anyways we got inside and damn what we see? No age class, from teenager to old people of +60 are there.
The party was so lame! So please , if you want to have fun, go somewhere else. And hit the like if you had same bad feeling here.; The whole family was disappointed. Average food, high price (but all brunch prices in Paris are extremely high). Hygiene is not high on their list.

If you want fine dining, this is not for you, but great burgers and food in a casual atmosphere is for you.  The staff are super cool and speak English.  Book, and loads of nearby parking...
My photos are rubbish, but the ones on their website are a true reflection; My absolute favorite tartare place in Paris! Went there twice in June 2024. Had different tartare creations. Both were really nice. The meat was so fresh. Would keep coming back every time I visit Paris. The service was great. The staff were cool.; Many images already but here you have another one of the Roman. It was very good but what stood out for me were the atmosphere and service. The guys were so casual, helpful and fast in delivering our food. Very very good value for the money, can‚Äôt wait to come back. Also notice the Reserve button in google and use it, they are fast at confirming that also.

You have a great business there, congratulations and vest wishes to you all.",48.8309972,2.3480279,13e

I would stay away from the heuvis rancheros, the tortilla was impossible to cut through.; I don't get homesick as much as many American expats, but I have to admit this place rang some nice bells for me. High-quality American diner cooking, which I sometimes still crave.

Hamburgers without pretense, milkshakes that taste like real milkshakes, and much better fries than I'm accustomed to in Paris.

The service is very friendly, bordering on jovial.

In regards to the actual dinner, the food consisted of classics presented in a modern way whilst also offering some newer dishes.

For lunch, I enjoyed a Grilled Cheese Pastrami, an omelette, and a tartlette for dessert. The Grilled Cheese Pastrami was delicious, with the perfect combination of melted cheese and flavorful pastrami. The omelette was light and fluffy, just right for a lunchtime dish. The tartlette was a delightful way to finish the meal, with its balanced sweetness and fresh ingredients.

I reserved my table through TheFork and received a 20% discount, which was a great bonus. Overall, Les P√©pites offers excellent food and warm service, making it an ideal choice for lunch in Paris.

A really pleasant surprise,  excellent attention to details and friendly atmosphere. Also very reasonable price, will definitely come back in future visits to Paris, without a doubt; Wonderful experience in a local bistro.

Food service is perfectly paced and allows you to enjoy the food and the company.

We loved it so much we went twice in five days. Merci Charlie!; Outstanding small place in the 15th Arr. We had great food starting with roast St Marcelin cheese. Mains were roast Angus beef, crusted chicken and the ‚Äúfamily‚Äù burger. Each had an outstanding sauce to enhance the flavor. The beef was tender, the chicken moist and the burger was tall and tasty on a brioche. The desserts were a tiramisu of whipped cream, Oreos and raspberries; chocolate lava cake, and saut√©ed plums. The whipped cream was delicious but the plums were the stand out of the evening, drenched in warm sugar caramel sauce. Great service despite one man handling all duties. Search this place out!!; We stumbled upon this French restaurant by chance, and what a delightful surprise it was! From the moment we walked in, we were warmly welcomed by the lone waiter, who, despite managing all the tables on his own, was incredibly professional and friendly. His attention to detail and kindness really added to our experience

The meal was simply amazing. We started with two appetizers: rillettes and terrine. We loved the option to share these dishes as a family, which made the experience even more enjoyable. Even though we're Irish, we absolutely fell in love with these authentic French flavors

As for the main courses, both the parents and the young adults were equally impressed. The tagine was beautifully aromatic, with perfectly balanced flavors and excellent cooking. The ribs were unbelievably tender, falling off the bone effortlessly, and with an excellent sauce. Every dish we tried was outstanding, prepared with great care and passion i think !!

Whether you're with friends or family, this is the perfect spot to enjoy authentic cuisine, all complemented by impeccable service, even when the waiter is handling the whole room on his own. Hats off to them, and thank you for an unforgettable evening !!!",48.8374269,2.2977625,15e

Despite the hot weather, the lack of air conditioning inside the restaurant was disappointing. We wanted to order cold drinks, but the ice machine was broken. However, they did offer ice water, which was appreciated.; An amazing brunch experience. Definitely have the full brunch. At ‚Ç¨28 it may seem a bit steep for breakfast but it‚Äôs an experience not to be missed. The coffee is excellent. Fresh juice. Delicious homemade granola starter and a main of your choice all included. I had the burrito and it was fantastic. Nice big portions. Avocado toast and the pancakes were to die for also! Friendly staff and they speak English. Owner is friendly dude from New Mexico in the US. We thoroughly enjoyed it here. Perfect stop around the corner from the Eiffel Tower.

The atmosphere is relaxed and casual, perfect for a dinner with friends. The decor is eccentric, kitsch, but cozy.

The food was good. I had egg with a mix of fried mushrooms and veg couscous. Both definitely tasty and well-prepared.

The menu is often changed, but vegetarian options are always available.

Service was friendly and efficient.

Overall, 750g is a reliable choice for a casual meal in Paris. It's a good option if you're looking for a comfortable place to eat with good food.; An excellent budget bistro.

I've had multiple entrees, mains and desserts and everything I've had has been very good to excellent.

On several occations there has been room for 2-4 without reservations.

Includes options of entree+main or main+desert for 22‚Ç¨, full 3 course for 26‚Ç¨, excellent value for money.

The pictures include a 'perfect egg', steak and fries and a rice pudding, all very good and tasty.

Can strongly recommend if you do not have a reservation for the night after a day at the expo center.; Food was good, not the best I‚Äôve had in France but it was pretty good, and the atmosphere was really great and cute! About half of the menu was gluten-feee or was able to be done gluten-free, which was nice but there wasn‚Äôt much detail provided in French or English on the dishes and how they were served.
Additionally, I will preference this next part by saying that we were there during the Olympics and it was probably 80% full, but our service was pretty bad. We ordered a bottle of wine when we sat down and had to ask 3 different people for it and it still took about 30 min to get it. We also asked for bread multiple times and it still took about 15 min, and our food was cold by the time the bread got there.; I really liked this restaurant. We were quickly seated just before 20:00, and the staff of young waiters was very friendly to my American colleagues who do not speak French (it's my first language). One co-worker was vegetarian, which is always a challenge in Paris, and she enjoyed a nice vegetable curry. I was happy that they had magr√®s de canard (duck breast) on the menu of specials. It was very good. Not great or awesome, but satisfying enough and I had a very pleasant meal. The ambiance is really nice. The glass-door terrace gives the place an outdoor feel while staying inside, away from the incessant French smokers. The decor is super lively and fun, quite refreshing with vibrant decorations and greenery. Definitely a recommended spot for a nice French dinner and a good break from the traditional Brasserie.; Good for value restaurant and obviously very popular among locals. We were quite amused to see that the local police also visits them and one even got a rousing birthday celebration.
The food is decent though some are obviously better than others.",48.8337422,2.2903283,15e

Definitely one of the experiences one shouldn't miss in Paris. We rediscovered Montmartre while learning all about it's fascinating history. This all thanks to the wonderful game-master Eglantine. She surely puts her heart and soul into the work. The game was fun, educational and professionally crafted.
I highly recommend it!; Eglantine was a wonderful host and we had an amazing time. My 11 year old son said it was his best experience in Paris and we tried to fit a lot in during our visit! It‚Äôs saying something! The puzzles were fun and enough of a challenge to keep our son engaged from start to finish (the parents too)! Eglantine gave us additional history and background during each stop during the game, took photos for us, and was charming and kind. We felt fortunate that Montmartre was ours to enjoy and that we could learn special things about a very special place. We highly recommend Eglantine and her experience.; Excellent hosting of the game by Jeanne and Anthony! Even with a super diverse group of 36 people from France, Italy and Spain they managed the activity well. Would highly recommend it as a team-building exercise!; The Escape game was very fun and informative.

We were not disappointed. The food was good and very tasty. There were also some slices with Pizza Bianca left. These were great!

It has 2 playground areas for children, separated by a street with cars passing by, so you have to choose. It also has an outdoors fitness area for adults.

The setting is beautiful, the tables are out in a garden and everything is gorgeous, tastefully decorated and calming to the soul. Disappointed in the service as it was very very long between each course and they actually forgot about our desserts (apparently they were sent to another table) the food was alright, nothing exceptional, seasonal produce well cooked but not well seasoned and no interesting spices or sauces.. a shame the food and service wasn‚Äôt to the same standard as the setting.; Wait was long despite only a few tables being served. They're under staffed when we visited, but they're pretty nice. Food taste wasn't so special, though pleasing in the eye and cost may be worth the maintenance of the restaurant in a romantic isle setting. I particularly love the cozy raft ride. Relaxing and romantic.; Honestly for the price point, I was quite disappointed by the service. I understand the appeal is the atmosphere, which is undoubtedly magical, but our waitress forgot our order twice and then brought our aperitif with our appetizers which we specifically asked for the two to be served separately. Personally, I don‚Äôt like to sip a fruity cocktail with a ceviche and I probably would‚Äôve ordered white wine with the appetizer had the cocktails not arrived at the same time as the first course. The waitress also completely forgot our table at the end so we did not want to wait around for dessert, although we might have ordered something had she not been so distracted. The lack of attention to detail in the service really brought down the quality of the overall experience, although the food was very good and the atmosphere lovely. For 18‚Ç¨ for an aperitif, I expect more from the service.; Greeted by a very rude waitress,

We asked to sit in the garden but she told us no, you will be sitting on the balcony knowing when we booked we asked for our table to be lower on the terrace.

We asked for water several times and the food was very ordinary,and not delicious; Delicious meals with good ideas in combining flavours. The ambiance is amazing near the lake. You reach the island by water shuttle for 2 euros.",48.863479,2.2602401,16e

Thank you for creating this haven for parents and kids!!!; The perfect cafe if you're in central Paris with small children. Gives the children a chance to run around, play, relax with books and enjoy a meal. Staff very friendly. The menu is a little limited for savoury meals.; Great little cafe if you have little ones. The staff are incredibly friendly! The coffee was good and the food was fantastic. We had a salad and a pesto pasta, while our 1-year-old loved the tomato pasta. The baby change and bathroom facilities are great, especially for kids.; There's no other place like Petite For√™t in Paris. Kids and families are not only welcome but it's a paradise, especially made for them. You can enjoy a hot (!) drink and a cake with delicious berries while the little ones play with the many beautiful and high quality, wooden toys, books etc. There're several stokke highchairs with different seats (yes, infant seats as well!) to make it more comfortable for everyone, playmat for the littlest, lots of space for the kiddos to play and move around, proper parking space for the pushchairs, delicious tea, coffee and cakes on the (expanding) menu, healthy snack and drinks for the children and honestly, I could just keep going on. The founders, Laura and Kaja are very kind and attentive who created the most amazing place for families. Did I mention¬† there's a bf pillow, changing table, several children's size toilets, all in a beautiful, clean and hygienic bathroom? Seriously, the list goes on.; I had the luck to find this lovely caf√© just after they opened. Inside it‚Äôs spacious and full of light, and very family/child friendly.

Will definitely be back!üíñü§© highly recommend; Was just walking by and decided to give the cafe a chance, I‚Äôm so glad I did!

The cozy interior is very charming, they host a lot of children workshops here in a separate playroom open for them to play in while their parents enjoy their meal / drink. There‚Äôs a large window looking into the playroom so parents can watch their kids but also have a bit of space to themselves, very family friendly and innovative. The atmosphere is very pleasant and welcoming; there‚Äôs mostly locals who stop by here but Ernestine Cafe is also very tourist friendly because the workers speak and understand English well.

The menu is diverse and creative, with all the food being made in house. They have a restroom in the back which makes it convenient to spend some time here. I ordered their brunch and left quiet full and content, will definitely stop by the next time I‚Äôm in Paris!; Ernestine is the caf√© I always wanted. It has delicious and wonderful caf√© options, the food is copious and nicely priced, there are ateliers and storytelling in English and French, and I feel relaxed and at home there. More importantly, so does my baby. Also, Yannis has an intuitive and sentimental capital that really lends the sense there is a love of children; it is not an attention confined to merely the children's section.; It is a very cosy and charming cafe with a special area for children. While our one year daughter is playing we can enjoy excellent macchiato. Don't miss this place if you have young kids and like very good coffee.; Super cosy and relaxing shop.",48.8911476,2.3310745,17e

I ended getting a cuttlefish and potato salad with an onion dressing and a vegetarian lasagne. Both dishes really hit it out of the park for me. I‚Äôm normally leaning carnivore, but had been overdoing it on the trip so far, and so I was happily surprised that the veg lasagne was possible the best veg one I‚Äôve ever had.

I tested 4 of them and the Maison des Sources is for sure the best. Great, pleasant team, equipment provided.
Only downside: the place is starting to be a victim of its success and is sometimes a little too busy for my taste.; Mixed reception, depending on the day of the week and the educators present. Some educators allow themselves to make judgments and comments on your attitude with your child, I have put her in her place as a guide and not a moralizing judge.
Otherwise the manager loves children and is very welcoming, needs to see his team again which is very uneven.; I only give one star to this rather beautiful initiative but there are several problems which do not make you want to return to the Maison des Sources. 1. The stock of books and toys is too poor. Many toys are too worn and damaged. 2. In the context of Covid, I have doubts about the proper washing of toys and the place in general. 3. And this is the most unpleasant point. Several times I witnessed the moralizing reflections that the facilitators (although each time different) allow themselves to make to nannies or parents about the education of children. I don't know who trains these employees in this psychology of the counter and who encourages them to behave like a moral police. In any case, what is certain is that those who bring children to play in this place really do not need to make comments in a belittling and childish tone, nor do we need a psychological analysis. straight from the magic hat.; Very warm welcome from the staff and other mothers for the first time as a grandmother with my 2 year old little boy...very pleasant place for the children...relaxation and discoveries",48.8716398,2.3827456,19e

No service thou. You have to make a queue & order & then pick it up. But worth it; We chose this restaurant for its convenience, as options were limited near the Zenith before a show.

The space boasts a spacious, cozy setting with an industrial vibe. However, the service was notably lacking, possibly due to being understaffed on a busy Saturday evening. Our ability to order food was restricted until 7 PM, although our server accommodated us at 6:50 PM. Despite this, our pizza order, even after several reminders, took over 40 minutes, leading us to cancel it. Both the sweet potato and bruschetta entr√©es were disappointing.

The tartare beef is served with peanuts and is gentle in taste. I find it interesting but I don‚Äôt describe it in a surprising way. I expected it rawer as a beef tartare should be. The sauce in the starter amazes me and I hope I would know how they make them so that I could try to do it on my own.; We waited an hour for our food, only to be told they'd completely forgotten about our order. The place was being run by two rather aggressive students, particularly the girl at the counter, who proceeded to shout at us when we calmly expressed our frustration about the service.
