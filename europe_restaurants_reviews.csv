Scully St James's,4.7,893.0,"['I love the atmosphere and friendly service of this restaurant, dishes were served quickly but you have a lot of time to enjoy them.\nThe portions are very generous and they are of great taste if you enjoy flavours, though you might found some dishes a little bit heavy on the use of oil.\nGenerally it is a restaurant I would revisit with friends, especially given the relaxed environment, you can see their kitchen and service being really friendly.', 'Scully St James‚Äôs truly has it all. Incredible food, atmosphere and service. Chef was incredibly kind to accommodate our late arrival and cook some amazingly flavorful dishes - highly recommend the tasting menu, but come hungry. We started with mushrooms, fried octopus and tomato salad. The sauces here deserve their own awards. Our starters and mains are shown in the pictures, and each was its own work of art in addition to be delicious.\nThe other standout? Luis and his fellow waitstaff. They didn‚Äôt make us feel rushed, offered suggestions and had great senses of humor.\nWhat else could you ask for? Oh, excellent cocktail and wine list - check. We enjoyed their take on an old fashioned and elderflower gin fizz, followed by Georgian, Spanish and French wines/champagne.\nPlan to spend two hours, enjoy the open kitchen and laid back feel. Cannot recommend more.', 'Quickly became my favourite restaurant in London (and I am a foodie). I‚Äôve been to 1 and 2 Michelin stars, but to me nothing compares to the experience Scully provides. The richness of flavours, the details, the innovative approach, the portions, the fact you basically have a chef‚Äôs table experience and get to watch him working up closely throughout the whole dinner, it‚Äôs unmatchable. Never had a better wine flight either - the wine pairing with the arepa it‚Äôs unbelievably good. My brother in law is vegan and he said he was the best tasting menu he had too. And the chef is so approachable and nice! I could spend hours writing about the incredible alchemy is done in here, but I will just say: BOOK YOUR TABLE.', 'What a wonderful experience. From start to finish everything was perfect. The hostess greeted us without even asking our names, then sat us in a nice area in the restaurant where we could see everything. The kitchen has an open concept, so it‚Äôs nice to see what they were doing without sitting at the counter. We were served our food at a nice pace and in enough time to catch our play at the theatre. Favourite dishes were the pork belly and spiced cake dessert. The aubergine was served cold, which would have been more complimentary warm or hot. The crispy rice cracker had a beautiful texture too.', '""We found the eating experience unique in offering shared portions and innovative food combinations. The staff were incredibly well informed and able to give in-depth detail which made our tasting explorative and stimulating. We will definitely\nbe back soon, thank you.""']"
Rules,4.6,2688.0,"[""Fantastic decor with lots of atmosphere.

We had the in season grouse and venison shin. The cocktails were insane: strong and flavorsome. The other dishes were great to. Staff were knowledgeable and welcoming. Steady pace to service and courses. Not rushed or slow. Great timing. We ate early, more of a late lunch at 5pm as we had a show to go to. Not sure how this would change at other times.', 'Fantastic place. Old London but despite the touristy edge, its actually fantastic.  The steak and kidney pie was awesome ( although I‚Äôm tinged with regret at not having the grouse).   Excellent cocktails, fantastic service and ambience.  A must try.', 'This was an Old English Restaurant. Had a wonderful wait staff, very knowledgeable and helpful. Not being familiar with English food, I went out of my normal. I had Potted Shrimp with toast for an appetizer, Beef and Kidney Pie as my entree, along with a Stilton and Walnut Salad. Everything was wonderful, and I surprised myself by how much I enjoyed everything. The real GEM was having a Guinness in a COLD Silver tankard. A very memorable occasion.', ""Dining at The Rules on Maiden Lane was an unforgettable experience. From the moment of arrival, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming, combining historic charm with modern sophistication. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable, ensuring every detail was perfect.\nThe menu showcased the best of British cuisine, with a focus on seasonal and locally sourced ingredients. Every dish was exquisite, with the venison standing out as particularly tender, flavorful, and expertly presented.

I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a special dining experience. I can't wait to return for another memorable meal."", ""It's The Ritz! What other review could there be?\nOf course the food is perfect. You can argue about the taste, some dishes were not to my liking, but that's my personal opinion. The only thing that is perfect is the desserts.\nThe service is top-notch. The waiters are very polite and helpful. Sometimes almost too much.\nThe prices are crazy, sure. But it's the The Ritz."", 'We so enjoyed our lunch. The set menu even included vegetarian options. The ambience, the service, and the fineness of the food offerings were all impressive and exceeded even our expectations, which were certainly high! Indeed beforehand we almost thought that the experience would be a little too fancy and snooty, but that was not the case at all. The care and concern was evident in everything from ensuring we were comfortable in our seats to checking on us throughout the meal and even giving us an additional dessert when there was a mistake in our order. My only quibbles would be that there was not a written menu for the tea selections, which I would have liked to see and peruse to make my choice, and the china sets that were used somewhat clashed with the interior.', 'It‚Äôs a wow experience-from the food, entertainment and service-we‚Äôll be back for sure! We loved each course-all presented as works of art-the appetizer-salad-sea bass-beef Wellington-crepes Suzette-Champagne-Port-entertainment‚Ä¶\n\nStaff makes you feel like royalty with an off the charts experience\n\nJazz vocalist we‚Äôve heard him sing at another venue in London and he‚Äôs fantastic-combining his talent with the 5pc band and then the performances by the dancing couple‚Ä¶vintage 20-30s era performance\n\nWorth every penny as the most expensive meal in London every year!\n\nThey deserve more than the 12.5% tip and we gave them their due!']"
Great British Restaurant,4.7,558.0,"['The Great British Restaurant has an upscale vibe within a posh atmosphere.\nOur waiter was OUTSTANDING.\nThe food was average-good in taste, portion size was on the smaller size and the meal was over priced in my opinion.', 'Great food and atmosphere.

The restaurant was high on my list to visit and I was very pleasantly impressed.\n\nThe food was incredible. The freshest produce used to make a delicious meal. We had Pork Tenderloin and Spring Lamb for mains, with this delightful Mushroom Souffl√©. All cooked to perfection. The all day menu has plenty of choices for all tastebuds.\n\nThe restaurant was beautifully decorated, with fresh white linen. The service was great and almost personal. The atmosphere was a bit drab considering it was a Friday night in Mayfair, it wasn‚Äôt that busy (which is probably blessing in disguise).\n\nA worthwhile experience, for all occasions.', 'The looks of the foods are so fab, however the taste could be more flavorful. Portion is relatively small. Nice environment near Green park.']"
The Ledbury,4.7,1514.0,"['the best service of all the Michelin restaurants we have ever been to. Very friendly and positive staff. Excellent wine list. The food is generally really tasty and creative. It a couple of portions, in my opinion, the perfect combination of flavors was sacrificed to showiness and populism (like the dish with black caviar, which completely negated the flavor range of the other, really interesting ingredients.\nOverall a really cool restaurant with a good atmosphere, service, thoughtful details of dishes and interior and decent food.', ""This place had been on my list for a while and it mostly lived up to expectations. We came for Friday night dinner and enjoyed the relaxed and inviting atmosphere which struck a perfect balance without feeling too formal. The food was largely excellent, though the dessert unfortunately wasn't to my taste which was a shame. My favourites from the tasting menu were the tuna, scallop, duck and the pre dessert. The service was polished, friendly and helpful."", 'lovely restaurant in a very nice area. i went there for my birthday. we felt welcomed from the beginning. super friendly staff with a lot knowledge. food was amazing. plating on point and super interesting flavors and techniques. i loves that they have their own farms with animals and are very close to their suppliers. i could taste the amazing quality. my wife has a bell pepper intolerance and she got a great substitute dish. the owner is super friendly and comes to the table to present some dishes. great guy. hopefully i will manage to come back one day.. i would totally recommend this restaurant and wish all the staff all the best.', 'One of my favorite 3 stars in the world! I think the price is so good for what you get. The food tastes amazing (there‚Äôs not a single dish that I don‚Äôt like, even the substitutions due to my dietary restrictions are well thought out, composed, dishes. And they are particularly good at seafood.) The service is on the next level. The first time I was here, they noticed that I wasn‚Äôt eating the sourdough crust, and for the next serving of bread they actually only gave me the middle parts!!!!!! This time around, my Mocktail came a little late and the sommelier felt so bad that he said it was on him! I have just been so impressed with the food and the attention to detail. I truly don‚Äôt understand how this could be only a 4.7!', ""Truly one of the best fine dining establishments in London. From the first starter to the final bite of dessert, there's a great combination of flavours. The cocktails were also exceptionally well done. A special shout out to the staff, as they were professional but not stuffy.""]"
Steak and Company - Leicester Square,4.4,4973.0,"['Absolutely fantastic place to eat. Everything we ordered was delicious and made to perfection.  My husband had hot stone experience and it was even better than expected. My BBQ ribs were finger licking good. No mention the starters...especially buffalo sauce - cauliflower, something new to us and we absolutely loved it. We also enjoyed happy hour, and the cocktails were amazing. Service was outstanding and we loved every minute spent there. We will definitely come back to this place for another hot stone experience.', 'Gorgeous outdoor dining space. Perfect for before or after the theater. Award winning, tender steaks, festive drinks and great service. The perfect spot for a lovely dinner. The truffle mash makes a great side! Restrooms are clean and don‚Äôt forget to save room for dessert!', 'Excellent food and service. Had a bit of a challenge as the instructions on how to cook the steak and burger were not followed. Ended up waiting over and over again (twice) to get it redone. The staff was very helpful to support though and tried their best to resolve. Food itself was very good and presented well. Felt it was a bit expensive. I did not see the value in the premium I paid (even the addition of a small sauce costs ~3.5¬£)- you can get a similar quality meal at least 15% cheaper. Atmosphere was very loud for me - every birthday (3 during a 1.5 hr experience) resulted in loud cheering both from staff and from some guests. Generally otherwise the environment was very loud too.', 'They have halal menu so it is perfect. The well-done meat was so hard. You should order for medium cooked meat if you want well-done. The starters were good but the chips were so few. Also, the inside of the restaurant is dark and so noisy.', 'I went to Steak and Company for the 1st time as I was visiting London for an event. The hot stone steak (10 oz ribeye) was recommended so I ordered it. I‚Äôve never had steak that way so wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. I had ordered the king prawn starter and that was so tasty. When the steak arrived the young waiter warned me about not touching the hot stone and I realised why. Actually finishing  the cooking of my steak myself to exactly how I liked it was a new dining out experience for me but I‚Äôll definitely be doing it again. One of the best steaks I‚Äôve had. I had the sticky toffee pudding for dessert which again was very tasty. Superb meal all round. Excellent service. Will definitely come back when I‚Äôm in London next.']"
Berners Tavern,4.5,2204.0,"['We were staying in the Edition and since we just flew in, decided to have dinner here to avoid the pouring rain outside.\n\nStylistically, this spot is gorgeously decorated although it seems like the ambience cannot decide if it‚Äôs time for serious business conversation or posh clubbing.\n\nWe were greeted by four different servers, the soon with the champagne cart, and the assistant somm. Great, lovely service!\n\nOnce we ordered and it became clear that we were ‚Äúonly‚Äù ordering an app and a main, plus one glass of bubbles and one glass of wine each, we were completely ignored. We had to ask for our check 3 times, and it finally arrived 30 minutes after we first asked for it. Logically, it included a 13% service fee for the wonderful service we did not experience.\n\nHow was the food? The octopus was great, although it was rather oily and a very small portion. The mushroom soup was not a soup, but some nicely cooked vegetables with way too much fresh tarragon. The pork pie was bland‚Ä¶ our waiter said it really needed salt and he didn‚Äôt have any. Perfect. The lamb rump was well cooked but missing the eggplant and anchovy flavor promised by the menu. The steak and fries were completely ‚Äúfine‚Äù. At these prices, the food should actually be better than forgettable fine. The wine and bubbles were similarly overpriced and forgettable. There‚Äôs so much good food and drink in London‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs just not at the Edition.', 'Food was nice, but did expect something a bit more given it was a Jason Atherton restaurant.\n\nThe setting was nice, classic decor but a lot of artworks which could be disturbing.\n\nFood on average would cost ¬£80 per person for two courses but if you add alcohol be prepared to pay about ¬£180 per person.', 'This place is incredible, one of the most iconic spaces I‚Äôve seen in london. The decor is just next level. Our meal was amazing, had the steak and salad. Cocktails were great as well, the service was next level!', 'Stunning interior with high ceilings and incredible hospitality. Tarzeem was the best server I‚Äôve had in ages, what a delight. Next time, I want to sit at the 2 top in the mezzanine!', 'I stayed at The Edition and had breakfast and dinner there for 2 days. Really love the vibes and the design.

The food was cooked to perfection, top quality, and it was a lovely time for dinner between 8:45 PM and 11:00 PM.', 'Overall good experience / decent quality but I think it‚Äôs overrated on Google/social media. The summer menu feels to me a very strong association and seasoning with seaweed (from starter to main dish) which is both very sweet and savoury (probably too salty).

Only the appetizer is good. 5 course on the memu are very ordinary, Third course Very saltyÔºàVeryÔºÅÔºÅÔºâ  Pork is very dry abd difficult to chew.

HIDE,4.5,3084.0,"[""During my recent visit to The Hide, I found the food to be decent but not particularly remarkable. Among the dishes we tried, the egg nest and grilled octopus stood out as the better options, showcasing some creativity and flavor. However, the overall dining experience was marred by service issues.\n\nIt was a busy night at the restaurant, which undoubtedly contributed to the challenges we faced in getting attention from our server. We often found ourselves needing to flag down someone just to refill our water or wine glasses, which is frustrating during a celebratory girls' night out in London.\n\nWhen our main courses arrived, there was a notable mix-up with the orders. The server seemed confused about which dish belonged to whom, which is quite unacceptable, especially in a busy restaurant setting. This added a layer of stress to the evening that detracted from our enjoyment.\n\nUltimately, the lack of timely refills for our drinks significantly impacted our experience. It‚Äôs disappointing when a night out is overshadowed by service shortcomings, despite the potential for a good meal. I hope The Hide can address these issues, as the food has promise, but the service needs improvement to match."", 'Wonderful dining experience!  Friendly, yet intimate!

Come here every couple of weeks to check out new pastries on the menu- always innovative! It is pricey, but as expected in Mayfair. Service not always on point (they seem to have a lot of rotation), but that‚Äôs just a detail and the food is worth it! Nice coffee selection with some interesting choices. Try it!', 'Immaculate, delightful breakfast full of flavour and taste. We visited twice to experience it. Granola bowl was almost a field of fruit and flowers, eggs perfectly poached on avocado or muffins, bread and muffins excellent char on the outside and soft warm centres. Service was superb, and they obviously remembered us on the second day with a warm welcome. Expensive, worth it, and cheaper than most of the park lane hotels down the road...\nEspresso ¬£7, Tea from ¬£5, most breakfast mains between ¬£15 to ¬£25.', 'Hide continues to impress! My first visit was for my birthday, and it was a truly memorable experience. I recently returned for brunch, and it was just as fantastic. The atmosphere is both elegant and welcoming.

Every dish was beautifully executed, the marriage of ingredients harmonious and creative, and I especially loved the Scottish Crab and pork dishes.

The smoked ribs were fall off the bone and can compete with TX, Kansas City, Memphis, etc. The mushroom parfait must be made with some secret magic, flavor was unreal.

Overall, the food and service made it worth the visit!', ""Amazing food and a great view of the kitchen from the kitchen bar. Cod's head was a fun eat to slowly pick at, the mushroom parfait and corn ribs were surprising flavours and very nice. Service was perfect. The venison ribs we ordered turned out tougher than expected, and the chef noticed us struggling and swapped it out immediately for the beef ribs. Will definitely return to try more of the menu."", 'We were just passing by the restaurant, not really sure what they served, and then Pam came over to help us out.

They were amazing! We also wanted some wine, and Pam was super patient, helping us pick the perfect one.

Unfortunately, one of the people I was with had some health issues, and found the outside heaters unbearable. When I brought this up with my waiter, they were rude and dismissive. I ended up addressing this with the hostess, who was kind enough to seat us at a different table indoors (for which we had initially booked!) that was waited on by someone else. The experience was greatly improved after this switch.\n\nThe food itself is inventive, appetizing, and aesthetic. There are many unique flavour combinations, and I enjoyed some of the superfluous garnishes (i.e. the Fallow emblazoned on the burger bun). Many of the dishes were able to be modified to suit a gluten free diet. I particularly enjoyed the Mushroom Parfait in both taste and texture.\n\nIt's a pity the service did not match the quality of the food!""]"

The difference is the Irish is grass fed and the USDA is corn fed . Its texture different, but tender enough for me . Here in England, that you have to order the bread separately. We also had the wedge salad, which was quite large, two separate halves of iceberg, but there was too  thin of blue cheese sauce. Perhaps a separate pot for those who want more with suffice. The strawberry white chocolate mousse, a big disappointment. The moose was not creamy at all. It was more thick sponge perhaps for being so old. The white chocolate that encased it was tasty. A champagne sorbet was blah.  Not a fan of this dessert at all. Excellent service!!!', ""What can I say? Smith & Wollensky is the best steak house I have ever been too. Apart from the cultural relevancy (Warren Buffets go to steakhouse), you honestly can't get any better.\n\nSuper succulent steak, meaty, flavourful and melt in your mouth. The sides, to die for, hashbrowns, creamed spinach with generous portion of cream, fries, sauces etc etc. I cannot think of anything wrong with the place! We've been here twice in a month, and maybe the price? Over ¬£1k between 4 people for two meals is a lot! Even for London standards, but oh god is it worth it.\n\nService is impeccable, we've had the same waiter for both occasions, and he has been excellent to cater to our needs.

The waiter checked in to make sure we weren't in a rush for the theatre. When we said we weren't, we were told we had plenty of time.  It's important to know that the steaks take about 35 minutes to prepare, so we ordered our starters then carried on looking at the menu to decide on the steaks. I had a 28 day dry-aged Irish sirloin with an au poivre crust. It was peppery and succulent. I'm a bigger fan of sirloin which is a cut I choose if I'm not going to go all out. Marble (aka fat) is not really a texture I enjoy so I go for the cuts without it, such as fillet.  My friend had the Australian Angus Rib Eye which was perfectly cooked. The sides are usually quite poor at steakhouses, but the creamed spinach was some of the best and the Iceberg Wedge did the job - in fact, it was huge so be warned!\n\nTomas the waiter was excellent. We appreciated is attention and flexibility throughout the meal. Asking us questions when appropriate and not interrupting our conversation. There was no rush to get us out, we sat at the table for two and a half hours.\n\nA great steak restaurant.

It was very nice to have the chocolate dessert with the words happy birthday brought to me. The service was fast and the staff were very kind. The only negative note, in my opinion, was the presence of stains on the chairs that also appeared a little worn, perhaps the upholstery should be freshened.

The seating is comfortable, and the overall ambiance is cozy.\nWhile the food was generally good, it didn't quite reach the heights of some other Italian restaurants I've tried. The Bruschetta Pomod was not bad, with a nice balance of flavors. The Parmigiana Al Fono was also enjoyable, featuring tender aubergine melted cheese. The Ravioli Tartufo was particularly delicious, with a rich truffle flavor.\nThat being said, I've had better Italian food elsewhere. The  branch in Covent Garden, for example, is a bit more impressive in terms of flavor and overall culinary experience."", ""What a shame about this restaurant.\nWe had been here a few years ago... and we liked it, so for my birthday we went back...\nWe sat down, but not everyone was there yet, but after about 15 minutes no one came to the table to ask if we wanted anything, water or cocktails, so I did call ‚Ä¶and there was even a little menu on the napkin‚Ä¶In other words, it doesn't even encourage sales... the waitress who took the order with an incredible desire to work, was probably on her last days of work, because everything indicated that she was displeased.\nThe wine was left in an ice bucket a few meters from the table, one of the invited guests got up twice to serve us, no one really cared.\nTo order the third bottle of water we asked 3 times, yes 3 times and then someone from the bar came and simply left the bottle on the table...it doesn't seem at all consistent with the supposed service of this restaurant or anything comparable to the previous experience.\nThe Frito Misto was oily and the shrimp in my pasta were overcooked and very poorly plated, out of place with the plate's monogram‚Ä¶but overall the food wasn't extraordinary but it was ok.\nThe other  waiter, or commis waiter who knew very little about what he was doing, gave the main course dishes to the customers...for desserts we had to ask for menus... very little for the restaurant in question and the waitress was talking to a colleague...\nIn the end I asked for the bill and service charge to be removed because it was really bad service, which is regrettable."", 'Went to San Carlo for the first time for a friends birthday celebration where she had booked the private dining room and we all paid for a set menu for the occasion.\n\nThe interior was really beautiful, lovely atmosphere and the food was nice for a set menu. Was a big fan of the panna cotta. The guy in the screenshot wearing the white chef jacket and apron deserves a mention as he gave really good service and was incredibly professional.\n\nThe experience at the restaurant and dinner service that evening was 4/5 star worthy until the end of the evening where we encountered a gentleman in a black suite (who I can only assume to be the manager) and was not there earlier in the night who‚Äôs tone was quite rude to us when it came to paying the bill. To give context we were fully aware that it was closing time for them and they were trying to get us out so I went up to the till to get the bill for everyone. At this point some people had already left as they were catching trains and they paid for their remaining amount (set menu was ¬£55, we each paid a deposit of ¬£25, so that evening the remaining to pay was ¬£30 + any drinks we ordered + service charge). As I had calculated my remaining to pay, the younger lady who had the card machine was putting the amount in and it was at this point that the gentleman said no we can‚Äôt do that, we‚Äôve never done that (even though they had literally done that for the others that left 30 minutes ago), and the bill had to be split equally between everyone that was left in the room.\n\nI understand why this is easier for them to do, but this was concerning for me as I knew there were some people in the group that did not order any alcoholic drinks so it would not have been fair on them to pay so much (each person would have to pay ¬£68 to split the bill equally - not including the ¬£25 we already paid as deposit) so in total ¬£93 per person for the evening. Though not an issue for some, the actual principle of not giving us a choice but to just tap our cards and leave and being spoken to in such a rude manner did really ruin the end of the night.\n\nThey had ample opportunity to give us the bill earlier in the night and even after they had given us dessert and this would have allowed us time to either calculate the split amongst ourselves and them enough time to make sure it matched the bill or simply just taken payments for each drink as they were ordered by the individuals. So then the split at the end done equally would have made sense.\n\nI‚Äôve worked in hospitality for both fine dining establishments and casual dining so I‚Äôm aware of what other solutions could have been presented with regards to the bill, but the attitude of that gentleman truly was shocking and outright lazy for not wanting to add up receipts. It is because of him that any interest I had in coming back to dine upstairs and try the a la carte menu is gone, and I will not be recommending San Carlo. I don‚Äôt want to make any assumptions based on my limited encounter with him, but even the way he spoke to the female waitress was very rude. We were a room full of women of colour so I hope that there was no discrimination at play on his part as to why his behaviour was like this towards us.']"

As a fan of themed dining, I was looking forward to the experience.

The restaurant is inside a hotel and the decor is amazing, and so was the ambience. Service was also impeccable and I have no bad words about it. We got the octopus to start, which was good- hardly any octopus inside but it was still tasty. We then got the lamb chops for main, which was good but lacked seasoning and had too much fat on it. We got the softshell crab burger which was magnificent, I loved the crunch and the depth of flavour. The mac and cheese was also really good, not too cheesy and well seasoned although I am a fan of a bit more spice. The fries were nice and crunchy, the peppercorn sauce wasn‚Äôt the greatest. I think 4 stars is fair but because we had a discount, 5 stars is fair. We had 30% off and our meal totalled ¬£70.

We have been to many Michelin star restaurants, have tried all the 3 stars in London, Ikoyi is simply on another level, I am certain they would have had the third star if Jeremy Chan is in the Michelin star inner circle. Flavor just simply exploded in your mouth layer after layer, we regretted that we didn‚Äôt come here sooner. I had tried African cuisine before but didn‚Äôt really enjoy it, but this is nothing like African cuisine, the use of spices are very subtle and everything is beautifully executed. If you are visiting London and want to treat yourself to a nice meal, look no more please, those overly hyped restaurants (e.g. most difficult to book) are not worth your money nor time.\nThey serve a shorter lunch menu Tuesday to Thursday if you don‚Äôt want to break the bank.', '""Extraordinary culinary performance! Fine dining at its best. Jeremy Chan, head chef, leads the team through the performance of the open kitchen concept, channeling all positive tension into the restaurant itself. The interior is simple and serene, perfect for focusing on the eclectic gastronomic concept, a fusion of African-Asian cuisine with intense spice usage and unique ingredients that set this restaurant apart. A unique aspect is that the signature dishes aren\'t the \'strongest\' ones, but two exceptional dishes preceding them (scallops and suya with creamed beans), offering a rhapsody of unexpected umami explosions. The service is exceptionally friendly. However, the atmosphere was disrupted by a table of overly loud guests, to the point where their noise drowned out the waiter\'s explanations of the dishes. This detracted from the overall impression as I couldn\'t hear information about the ingredients used in the dishes due to the noise. Since it\'s a blind tasting and the menu received at the end provides extremely limited information, unfortunately, the impression remains incomplete. Excellent cocktails.""']"

The rabbit raviolo had pretty basic taste but the onion velout√© was nice and balanced the overall taste. The pancetta was too stiff in my opinion. Okay overall but not something I‚Äôd order again. The mains were pretty good. Aged beef rump cap had a right level of tenderness and the oxtail and bacon fondant was an amazing addition. The pork presa itself was nothing special as a meat cut, but the overall dish was offset by the crackling, nice sauces and pickled veggies - they played well together and left a pleasant impression. The desserts were definitely a highlight! Amazing passion fruit souffl√© with ice cream - just melted in my mouth and the balance between sweet and sour was delightful. The salted caramel malt tart was one of the best desserts in my life - definitely a hit for the salted caramel lovers. The stout ice cream was a great addition although it melted quickly and became watery. The suggested wine pairings for the desserts were great. The staff was reasonably attentive with no major hiccups. One minor thing was that they were late to remove the amuse bouche plates but I did not mind at all. However, it definitely felt like some guests were more special than the others which I am not sure should be the case for a Michelin starred restaurants. The interior was very basic and had many aspects which would benefit from some maintenance - for example the water temperature and pressure in the bathroom or ceiling paint around the lamps.']"

When we wanted to add tips to our bill, the waiter was very frank and honest and pointed out that service charge had already been included and wanted to confirm that we wish to add additional gratuity.

Inconsistent cooking throughout the entire ribeye. Very hard to cut through. Would recommend restaurant to sharpen their knives.\n\nThe dessert though BLEW US AWAY!!! We had just recently eaten at Epicure (a 3 star Michelin restaurant) and the lime cheesecake at this place was on par or even better than the dessert epicure served depending on preferences. The cr√®me br√ªl√©e was also very good, but the only thing is the cr√®me was slightly inconsistent throughout. Some bites were mouthwatering and incredible while others were average.\n\nOverall, it was decent for a last minute dinner. We booked it online prior. We were seated in a weird area of the restaurant thus did not get to enjoy the ambiance compared to others as much. The organic Rasteau wine was very good.', 'Truly a magical dinner experience.

I figured that it would be a long lunch which turned out to be a four and half hour lunch. Yes, the longest lunch of our lives. And it was worth every single minute!\n\nThe restaurant inside Hotel Le Bristol is gorgeous. We were met with a beautiful arrangement of flowers and rugs of pinks and violets. The warm reddish tones continued into the dining room where we were greeted with warmth by the staff.\n\nThe food here was exceptional with not a single course veering off in excellence. It ranged from the signature caviar with potato mousseline smoked in haddock with buckwheat crips and sour cream dressing, full of umami to the perfectly cooked langoustine in lemon and thyme, onion mango and broth flavored with coriander and citrus fruits. The candele macaroni with black truffle, artichoke and foie gras filling in parmesan cheese, and black truffle juice reminded of a similar dish at Acquerello in San Francisco in visual appearance and ingredients.\n\nOut of the entire lunch full of numerous courses, there were three highlights. The salmon from Scotland in powder of tandoori spices, fennel and cucumber with mint oil and rice vinegar was stunning. Simply, it was the best cooked salmon I‚Äôve ever had in my life so far. If salmon is this good in Scotland, I wonder what other types of seafood exists in Scotland‚Ä¶ Before this, the best salmon I had was from Alaska. The hen breast poached in a bladder was incredibly moist that it cut like butter and the green asparagus with morels that accompanied it in a wine reduction with crayfish and golden chanterelles with Xeres was incredible. I immediately had a flash back to the piece of chicken served at La Grenouille in NYC some 16 years ago which was the best I‚Äôve ever had until this dish. To continue this momentum the trolley of macarons and chocolates were incredibly flavorful. I believe she said that the macarons were made on the premise every day. We love macarons and to hear my wife say that these are the best macarons I‚Äôve had so far brought immense joy.\n\nTo mark our honeymoon, the staff spread red rose petals and an edible sugar sculpture on our table during dessert time. They were genuine, warm, attentive, and clear professionals at hospitality. They made us feel special and well cared for throughout our 4.5 hour lunch for a very memorable experience.\n\nMerci beaucoup, Epicure!', ""It's hard to describe just how good this place is. We've done Kei and Le Clarence in Paris which were both phenomenal and this edged out both of them. There were literally no misses as far as the plates go and I enjoyed how tasty and yet creative and sometimes cerebral each course was. There was always a play on color, texture and sometimes temperature executed with perfect finesse. It's french cuisine yes but it wasn't completely bound by that. The salmon for example was crusted with tandoori spice and came with a raita like sauce, quite a pleasant surprise.""]"

We went to check it out and were intrigued by the fact that we would be served a menu chosen by the chef with 4 or 5 dishes specially prepared for each night. We added to the uncertainty and expectations of what would be served, observing the neighboring tables. The dishes that followed us on our unknown journey were compositions with fish, seafood and vegetables. An explosion of flavors with fresh ingredients, enhanced by the seasonings and sauces of the dishes. Highlights include the octopus with tempura, the flounder fish with roasted lettuce and a delicious dessert with cherry ice cream with a lemon mousse and a cupcake.

We had missed our original lunch reservation due to a delayed flight, but we were delighted to have made it to dinner instead. The menu is a surprise blind menu, and changes daily based on the fresh ingredients available that day.  Each dish is distinct and flavorsome, but with all elements well-balanced, such as the combination of asparagus, pistachio, and pumpkin seeds or beetroot, cherry, and tomato.

I was expecting more options for the food menu, but I did not check before making my reservation, so that was on me. I ordered the perfect egg to start, and the duck breast for my main course. The perfect egg was delicious, although I would‚Äôve preferred the sauce to be served warmer. The crispy onions on top make the dish a 5 star experience. The duck was the main reason for the loss of one star, but this is based off of personal preference, and not the quality of the dish. It was a very tender and well prepared duck breast. Crispy flavorful crust, but I would have preferred it to be more cooked through. Again, this is my preference, and not necessarily how duck breast should be cooked. The orange marmalade sauce was a good pairing, but the mint potato puree was not my favorite. It works well in the dish, but the mint was overpowering whenever I took a single bite of just the puree. All in all a well prepared meal and good atmosphere. Would recommend this restaurant to others visiting Paris.', 'Love La Couvee! This was our second time going to La Couvee. We stumbled upon it by chance as it was close to our hotel last time we visited Paris, and knew we had to come back when visiting again. Both times I‚Äôve been amazed by how well they prepare their seafood. Simply delicious! This time we got the sea bream, duck, and lobster. The sea bream and lobster were so yummy! The duck was okay. For dessert the chocolate mousse was so well balanced - light yet rich. The restaurant is also so aesthetic and the service is extremely friendly and kind.

The wine pairings and descriptions were very thoughtful.', 'To sum it up:Fantastic service, good food! Creative and sophisticated vegetarian (and of course carnivore) dishes. We visited in the evening and the waiter remembered the notes I gave for the reservation (e.g. congratulated my mother‚Äôs birthday as well which I noted we are coming in for). The food: it was good, tasty and thought-through - but it was missing an extra bit of something to make it great. The ‚Äúwow‚Äù was missing. E.g. the second dessert was a vanilla and Earl-Grey infused cream with a strawberry on the side. Tasted good but something I already had at an ice cream cafe before. We did not opt for the wine pairing which maybe would have made it a more wholesome experience. The service: fantastic! Waiter and chefs are really welcoming and pay attention about your wellbeing. They present each course at the table and answer questions. If they are able to match the food to the standard of the service, I believe the Michelin Star would stand a lot stronger! Nonetheless, a great evening!', 'Very good restaurant, with options for menus, tasty food and good wines to go with them. I found the dishes creative and modern. The service was also pleasant and attentive, making our weekday 3 course lunch go by almost too quickly. Was happy that they were able to change some ingredients based on preferences of one in our party, who really enjoyed the meal.\nMy only critique is that they add the option, and verbally emphasise, for a tip can be added when paying the bill with pre-selected options of percentages to choose from. This creates an expectation to tip, which is a practice I have only seen in tourist areas (been living in France for a decade, never seen a restaurant outside of a tourist area offer this option). However, this is totally unnecessary - tipping is not required in France as servers are paid a living wage and service is included already on the bill. If a person chooses, they leave a few euros - not 10-15% of an expensive bill. This extracts extra money from the client, who is already paying a lot for a nice meal (especially if it is a tourist who is also dealing with exchange rates!), and guilt for people who have to, in front of the server, choose no tip. For a high end restaurant, i am truly surprised at this practice given both the amount of money it represents and the ‚Äòbad taste‚Äô it could leave on the way out. Thought about giving a lower star for this (I wish 4.5 was an option!), but I think its unfair to the rest of the experience - but wanted to note in hopes that the management reviews this unnecessary and counter-cultural practice.']"

The service also fell short, with the waiters rushing through the explanations of each dish and walking away before finishing, leaving no time for questions.

Originally, I wanted duck, but they were out and I ordered steak instead. The presentation on the food was lacking,  there was a lack of taste to our food, and our order was mixed up at the beginning of service. The pricing for the food wasn't worth it either.

Away from the craziness of some touristic spots!', 'We were seeking one last classic Parisian bistro for our brief visit and Le Trumilou has been touted as one of Paris grand old birds of the bistro world.\n\nWe opted for a table outside, as the evening had promised rain, but it held off. What better way than to end the trip with a dinner alongside the Seine? While I enjoy sitting at cafes outdoors and enjoying the passing scene in Paris, this was not quite the quaint urban scene one might expect. The quai de l‚ÄôH√¥tel de Ville is a busy traffic-thoroughfare and so the continual traffic might distract a little from the ambience.\n\nWe started with a Kir Royal and this was a fantastic gem of a representation of this classic. Dark and ruby and redolent with cassis, it sat wonderfully on the tongue.  A promising start.\n\nThis was followed by the avocado caviar, with a basket of sliced baguette. The salad was marginally wilted and the avocado on the verge of browning, but the dish was still palatable. A pretty presentation perhaps hiding a slightly fading glory.  It was passable.\n\nThe beef filet with black pepper sauce was devoured, along with an accompanying side of mashed potatoes. This dish was well-received.\n\nThe free-range chicken, however, was not quite so happily regarded. It arrived swimming in its cider sauce and over-cooked. Dry and clinging to the bone, it was eventually pulled out into the mire of the sauce. Not its finest hour.\n\nThe mushroom fricass√©e was a welcome respite from the risottos often on offer for vegetarians. Fried mushrooms are always a delight. If there was one negative to this dish, it was that there might have been some form of contrast to go with it. Fried mushrooms and burrata might well have paired well with some toasted bread or crunchier vegetable, for example. Otherwise, quite good.\n\nTo finish things off, we ordered a dish of classic profiteroles. And classic they were. Light, ice creamy and doused in chocolate sauce, with a side of whipped cream. Delightful.\n\nWorthy of a name in the best and most classic Parisian bistros? Without having tried a bunch more, that‚Äôs hard to say. Good? Yes. Outstanding?

The Indian server asked how the food was when I told him the Pintza was inedible and we didn‚Äôt want it he stood and stared at us for a second. ( I think he was trying to intimidate us or make us feel bad. When I asked him what he was staring at or if he was confused and to remove the pintza off the bill. he was like I‚Äôll tell the head waiter, which he never did. Then I asked for the check the check came with the pintza on it. I instructed him again to remove it and he was he said no. I said ok than try to make me pay, at which point he got the waiter called me a bruto and some other words which I didn‚Äôt understand. I spoke to the waiter that was understanding and removed it without hesitation and apologized. Moral of the story is place id never go back to eat the poorly made steak or disgusting pintza.

We were told a hard NO and basically told to pick a dish each or we should go elsewhere. We had wandered around long enough so just picked a dish each. This created quite a hostile environment between our table and the waiters who were not very attentive at all. The food we ordered tasted delicious, but had had better elsewhere. When other tables started to fill we could see that there was people sharing different options, so maybe we either got a less friendly waiter, or it was another typical Italian scam.\nHowever, the bathroom was DISGUSTING. I had to wait for a lady and a gentleman prior to me to be able to go (about 10 minutes).

It is not inedible, but I would rather go somewhere else. We ordered seafood risotto, seafood fettuccine and fried calamari and shrimp for mains. We also ordered suppli and tiramisu. The mains were a huge let down. The fried calamari and shrimp were not crispy and tasted bland. Much seasoning was needed. The seafood flavor of fettuccine and risotto was okay, but the fettuccine was almost cold when it was served. I think the kitchen must have cooked both the fried food and fettuccine at the same time with risotto. Therefore when they were served altogether, the fettuccine and fried calamari were already cold and fried food was soggy, as they all must have waited for the risotto to be cooked.

More, a stodgy off cut pancake with all the character of a mummy. But it was a character actor compared to the celeriac, which had somehow come from a factory farm intent on size, not flavour. The cauliflower came with steamed veggies, not even adorned with seasoning and olive oil, and the celeriac found a reasonable salad of cucumber and potato.

PeterPaul,4.7,980.0,"[""I am so glad I made a reservation here. It is a culinary experience, which is great. After ten days in Germany, this was one of our last places to eat. I'm glad.\n\nI'm going to say something that might be controversial, and I don't mean anything negative by it. I've traveled to many countries and have always found some particular regional food to be amazing. I struggled in Germany. The German food seemed to be bland and lack sauces and, well, spices. I kept trying in various cities and various restaurants. It's not bad, just kind of boring?\n\nSo, I'm glad I went to Peter Paul at the end because they elevate traditional German food and allow one to taste, in small size, various dishes. It was great.

The atmosphere is great, the service is very very charming. A very good social and feel good ambiance. Yet the foods are German :) made by porc, meatballs, cabbage and potatoes, etc :) and thus -I am sorry to say - one shouldn't expect much in gastronomic terms.

Upper Burger Grill,4.7,6066.0,"['I‚Äôve tried Upper Burger Grill at Rankestra√üe 3, 10789 Berlin multiple times a few years ago when I was regularly in Berlin.

The burger patties, seasoning, and overall taste were impressive.\n\nHowever, my recent visit was a bit disappointing. This time, I opted for the Upper Wild Burger and Truffled Fries. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt like or enjoy them. While the burger size was big enough, the taste didn‚Äôt meet my expectations. The flavors were bland, and the patty lacked the delicious seasoning I remembered. The truffled fries were also underwhelming, missing the distinctive truffle flavor and being overly greasy.\n\nOverall, my experience this time was average, which is a stark contrast to my past visits. I hope they can improve the quality and taste of their food to match their previous standards.', 'The burger is good but there ist better. They fries was really good would recommend one to share for 2. They have a big selection of burgers. The chicken burger patty is more like the patty from the D√∂ner shop so for me it was really over priced.

The menu offers a variety of delicious options, each dish prepared with care and bursting with flavor. Their wine selection is impressive, featuring choices that complement the food perfectly.

Additionally, the music was incredibly loud, creating a noisy environment that overshadowed the enjoyment of the meal. Unfortunately, I had to shout to converse with my husband, which detracted from the overall experience. While the food and wine at Belucci are top-notch, the noise level and crowding can make it challenging to fully appreciate the meal.

The place is absolutely stunning, like something right out of a movie.\n\nThe food was good, with the croquettes and tartar being my favorites. However, despite the many tables available, we were seated next to a table of very loud guests, which made it difficult to fully enjoy our dinner in such a beautiful setting.\n\nAdditionally, the music played during our dinner did not match the restaurant's elegant atmosphere. It felt a bit out of place with upbeat, contemporary hits that were more suitable for a bar or nightclub, rather than a candlelit dinner.\n\nOverall, while Bodega de los Secretos has a lot of potential with its beautiful ambiance and tasty food, our experience was marred by the noise and music choices. Sadly, we would not return."", 'Great food! We ordered the grilled scallops, entrecote, oxtail rolls as savory and cheesecake (tarta de queso), chocolate lava cake and ice cream for desert.

Nice To Meet You Restaurant & Lounge,4.7,3644.0,"[""We were able to sit on the balcony and enjoy the beautiful views. The food was great, but I'd argue not the best I've had in the area.

Although the food was really good (duck confit with orange sauce, salmon with rice, and steak) - would revisit for the food, we had to wait an hour before our order arrived.

We had complimentary bread and chickpea sauce once we were seated.\n\nThe tiramisu had too much of a strong coffee flavor in my opinion and it felt like it was just made when we ordered so the lady fingers weren‚Äôt soaked enough. The cake and ice cream were a better/safer choice. The cocktails were good too.\n\nThe atmosphere was calm but I don‚Äôt think for high end fine dining.

Great for an evening with a partner/friend or a celebratory occasion. Make sure to sit outside on the balcony to enjoy the view of the city.', 'I had a disappointing experience at this restaurant. Terrible service and tasteless food. I ordered grilled octopus, which, as you can see from the photo, clearly wasn‚Äôt grilled at all. The mashed potatoes tasted like freeze-dried potato.

I‚Äòve chosen this restaurant due to all the positive reviews but when we visited I missed the excellent attributes.\n\nTo be fair - the food is not bad and the ribeye we had was very good. But overall the dishes lack a level of finesse as the tartar f.e was nicely plated but it tasted rather bland. The Empanada that followed got us all excited again as it was really tasty but then the Wagyu Tataki followed and the first real disappointment hit. It did not taste like wagyu at all and wasn‚Äòt really tender either. They also covered it in too much soy sauce which killed the taste completely.\n\nAs already mentioned the 300g ribeye was good and perfectly cooked - so definitely go for this one. The 300g (45days matured) entrecote on the other hand was rather dull in taste and quite chewy.\n\nWe finished the evening with an equally disappointing Tiramisu - where the biscuits have probably been drowned in a watery americano mixture.\n\nSo all in all I won‚Äòt pay the restaurant another visit but to be fair the food isn‚Äòt bad per se. It‚Äòs just not great or exciting and that was probably what I was hoping for.

This was just divine! The blood sausage starter was unctious when you have it with bread and the artichokes were beautifully done filled with a delicate mushroom cream, just enough to balance the flavours but not overpower it. The setting is beautiful low lighting with candle ""trees"" at the entrance. Upmarket but with serious quality of food and in my opinion, definite value for money. We had a lovely experience there.', 'My boyfriend took me out for our anniversary.

I love that they offer an English menu and a variety of options. A must visit', 'We had an amazing dinner at La Vaca Argentina Ventura. Service was also impeccable, the servers were very nice and could speak English/Spanish. We ordered a bottle of wine, scallops with chimichurri, Argentinian blood sausage, creole empanada, bife de chorizo and beef medallions, and dulce de leche/pistachio ice cream. The dulce de leche ice cream is the best dessert I‚Äôve ever had, we had to order another one. The warm green drink (pictured) they provided at the beginning was also delicious, I wish I had the recipe! My favorite appetizer was the scallops with chimichurri, except they were on the smaller side. My boyfriend got the bife de chorizo and I liked it more than my beef medallions. He ordered the bife de chorizo lower loin medium rare temperature and while it appears to look rare, it tasted phenomenal. We usually order steaks medium rare and did not feel that the rareness of his steak made it worse in any way or changed the integrity/texture because the steak was so tender and seasoned well. Everything was worth the value. We would 1000% go again and recommend it to everyone! Hope they will open one in the United States!!']"

The servers are cooperative and attractive, the wines recommended by a young girl are so good and match the dishes. Marta is friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable, and she explained all the dishes in detail to us.\nNadia was in charge of the kitchen that night, and my wife was very pleased for her. She is charming, looks confident, shows professional, skillful, and takes responsibility.\nIt can show that not only the trust between Chef Iker and the team is strong, but also the management and empowerment too.\nI have been Barcelona twice and tried many fine dining restaurants, UMA gave me the differences. Will come again if I am in Barcelona.\nOnce again, thank you.']"

The flavours were not overly complex, they paired well together and the myriad of textures made it a party in our mouth.\n\nService was impeccable from the minute we walked right up till we left.

Without asking she gave me an extra lemon for my squid when she saw me squeezing out the last drops of my original one. The prices are not inflated like the other restaurants in the area. The vibe is casual but friendly. The location hidden but accessible. The locals hang here. It really is a hidden gem. The interior is warm and inviting, vintage style which I love. Their menu is only in Spanish with no pictures and the waitresses do not speak English which poses a problem to foreigners but it is an authentic experience. So on my second visit I prepared myself with pictures that I screenshot from the reviews of others and pointed to them to the waitress. So much easier. My first meal was the lunch menu. Reasonable at 14 euros something with entree, main and dessert. The salad was fresh with an amazing dressing. The stew was melt in your mouth. The dessert tasted delicious and not too sweet. On my second visit, for a brunch, I tried the tapas. I ordered the fried squid (soft and bouncy) and the potato tortilla served with slices of bread slathered with the juice of the tomato and sprinkled with just enough salt to enhance the flavour. I particularly loved the tortilla. Goodness I was in heaven. It was perfecto! Fluffy and you could taste the earthy potatoes. The expresso was also nice and strong not watery which some places do.

The restaurant was busy buy we got a table. The waiter was incredibly lovely, taking time to explain the dishes and the pairings and making jokes with us. His English was fantastic and he was very hospitable. The food was absolutely gorgeous! A few days later, after talking about the food from this restaurant constantly, we decided to go back. This time, it was completely different! There was only one waiter and one barman. The poor waiter was waiting the whole restaurant! Upstairs and downstairs! It was incredibly busy, just like the first time we visited but this time he was alone with no other waiters. First of all, it took ages for someone to even come and take our orders, then when they did, we had to wait ages for our food order. Our food came out with such huge gaps in between, we were left waiting over half an hour sometimes for the next dishes. When the dishes came.out, one toast that we enjoyed the first time was so cold and we didn't not enjoy it-probably because the food was ready early but the waiter was busy with the other orders so it was left on the side for a long time. We didn't even bother to get dessert this time because we couldn't afford to waste our evening for another hour to wait to get a dessert. The waiter was really apologetic that he had not been able to tend to us more during the second visut, but we could see how fast he was working but it was not enough for one person. This makes me sad to write this review because it's a wonderful venue, the food is the best I had in Barcelona and the waiter was so incredible lovely, but he is clearly run off his feet and needs help to serve customers in this restaurant. The fact that this is a tapas restaurant, the waiters are needed more because people order quite a few dishes at the same time and the waiter needs to be constantly there for then. I urge the management to sort this out, otherwise customers will be driven away from possibly the best tapas bar for many tourists.""]"

He was attentive to any questions we had about the menu or suggestions about wines. I must say though I was very disappointed in my food. I started with the parmigiano which was dry; lacking any sauce and almost tasted burnt. My friends had the octopus, and it was very delicious. The texture and sauce were perfect. Unfortunately, my next dish wasn‚Äôt as good as the octopus. I had the Raviolo and it was terrible, so much so that I couldn‚Äôt even attempt to finish it. So that was a wasted 23 euro, and I was afraid to say I didn‚Äôt like the dish because I didn‚Äôt know how they‚Äôd react. Instead I just kept sipping on the wine to get rid of the bad taste. My friends had the linguine granchio which I didn‚Äôt care for either, and the tagliatelle alla bolognes, which was actually very very good. I wish I had just ordered that instead. For dessert we had the panna cotta and cr√®me br√ªl√©e which to my surprise were actually very good, but the tiramisu, not so much. It wasn‚Äôt that it was terrible, it was just different. Mani In Pasta had a far better tiramisu. Overall, I don‚Äôt think this restaurant was worth the over 300 euro we spent there.

The pasta is very salty, way too much from Asian perspective - I directly gave up from eating after a few bites. The red prawn carpaccio was refreshing and good.

The restaurant is lead by two Austrians, therefore you‚Äôll get exclusive Austrian wine of Austrian wine-growing regions there.\n\nThe 6 courses menu started with a steamed veal wantan with chicory and radish. The wantan had an incredibly delicate taste and the lightly fried chicory was a bit smoky which matched perfectly. The taste of the dish was rounded off with an intense peanut/nut paste and a crunchy seaweed chip. It followed with a filled zucchini blossom with chanterelles and verbena. Not just beautiful for the eye. Everything was perfectly coordinated. It tasted incredibly tender. Afterwards we had Rainbow trout with parsley root and lemon verbena. The main course was a top dish of Poltinger lamb with smoky peppers, onion confit and filled eggplant. Incredible tasteful and served with a strong red wine. The Alpine cheese from Affineur jamei with figs and brown bread in-between was a light course and made you already curious about the next dish. The crowning glory of the evening was an almond cake and white chocolate mousse with plums. The accompanying wine was always matched perfectly to the nuances of the different flavours. All in all a great dining experience!\n\nImportant: If you want the menu served with accompanying wine, you‚Äôll need to ask for that on an explicit way, otherwise you just get any wine served which doesn‚Äôt really match with the dish.\nTip: Come and have the smaller 3-course evening meal (limited stay until 7:30 p.m.).']"

State Bird Provisions,4.5,2105.0,"[""This Michelin star restaurant is different compared to most that I've been to. First of all they don't have a traditional 4 course or 9 course meal. The waiters walk by your table with the dishes already prepared and ask you if you would like the dish. So you can be served quickly. However the food wasn't made seconds ago and brought to you. Which is the downside. I ordered 10 dishes. My favorite were all three pancakes I tried. The next would be the cucumber, tomatoes, trout and chips, oysters, and pork belly salad.

But the format left something to be desired. They went with a dim-sum format which I have no problem with, generally speaking, but the cadence was rapid-fire. I was still half way through one plate, chewing on a bite when the next tray of food came by. Each tray was of one type of food that you could choose or decline. Sometimes you had two or even three servers with trays around you, in the tiny space. I really didn‚Äôt have time to enjoy or savor any one dish when the next one came by a few minutes later. It was also quite impossible to have a conversation with your table-mate without constantly being interrupted by the servers offering the next option. Or asking if you need anything. Or filling you water glass. Or clearing a plate.\nEach option only came by once so if you skipped one, you had to remember it, in case you wanted it later, so you could ask the server.

Fog Harbor Fish House,4.5,7798.0,"['Fog Harbor Fish House was a decent dinner at the end of a long day.\n\nThe calamari and blue cheese garlic bread appetizers were super tasty, although I‚Äôve never seen fried jalape√±os in calamari before! The garlic flavor in the bread could‚Äôve been stronger - it couldn‚Äôt stand up to the cheese at all. That being said, I haven‚Äôt seen baked blue cheese garlic bread anywhere else and it was still very good.\n\nThe clam chowder was delicious. I added the crab meat, which was just sprinkled on top and wasn‚Äôt worth the $7 additional charge. It made the soup too rich. The bread bowl was overwhelming but that‚Äôs going to boil down to personal preference. I‚Äôm glad I tried it but now I know I‚Äôm not a bread bowl person!\n\nUnfortunately, the lobster roll was very basic and underwhelming. No garnish or greenery of any kind to add a fresh element to the dish and the lobster meat was extremely under-seasoned.\n\nDon‚Äôt forget to double check your bill at the end of the night - an extra $4.50 was added on to my clam chowder, seemingly because the wrong up charge for the crab meat was calculated. Our wonderful server quickly fixed it for us! The meal overall was good but not great. The appetizers were a strong start but the mains weren‚Äôt up to the same standard.', 'Fog Harbor at Pier 39 is hands down one of my favorite seafood restaurants in San Francisco. Every visit is a treat, and I always leave looking forward to my next. The atmosphere is inviting, and the views from the restaurant are simply stunning‚Äîyou get to enjoy the vibrant energy of Pier 39 with a perfect view of the harbor and the sea lions.\n\nThe food is incredible, starting with their signature clam chowder served in a sourdough bowl. I always add crab meat, which takes it to a whole new level. It‚Äôs rich, flavorful, and easily one of the best chowders I‚Äôve had in the city. The shellfish platters are also fantastic, always fresh and cooked to perfection. Whether it‚Äôs the crab, oysters, or shrimp, every bite feels like a true taste of San Francisco.\n\nService here is great, although you should be prepared for long wait times, especially during peak hours. The line is a testament to how popular this spot is, but trust me, it‚Äôs worth the wait. The staff is friendly, attentive, and they help make the experience even more enjoyable.\n\nOverall, Fog Harbor delivers on all fronts‚Äîdelicious food, great service, and incredible views. It‚Äôs a must-visit for anyone craving fresh seafood and a classic San Francisco dining experience.', 'My friend and I visited Fog Harbor at Pier 39 this week and had a truly delightful experience. Despite a brief wait beyond our reservation time due to the crowd, we were seated at a window table with a amazing view of the pier and the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nThe service was exceptional, thanks to our waiter (sorry for being forgotten your name sir) who was very attentive and recommended several dishes. We decided on the shell platter for two, clam chowder, and a bottle of wine.

I highly recommend Fog Harbor to anyone looking for a great dining experience in SF.', 'Fog Harbor Fish House is a great spot for dinner, especially if you enjoy seafood. The fruity beer they offer is definitely a highlight.

Portions are generous.', 'Highly recommended. Vibrant atmosphere, knowledgeable service, well executed dishes, and inventive cocktails. The pork chop and the stracciatella starter were mind blowing.

The restaurant was clean and well-presented throughout our visit.\n\nFood-wise, the salad was a standout‚Äîit was honestly the best restaurant salad I‚Äôve ever had. The staff spun and tossed it right in front of us, which was a nice touch. For my main course, I had the house prime rib, and it was juicy and well-cooked, though it didn‚Äôt completely wow me. My sides, creamed corn and mashed potatoes with gravy, were solid accompaniments. We also had a bottle of the house wine, which paired nicely with our meal.\n\nThe restaurant has a full bar, but our server didn‚Äôt mention this to us‚Äîwe only found out by overhearing another waiter tell a nearby table. It would have been nice if that had been communicated better. However, everyone we interacted with was incredibly friendly, which made the experience enjoyable.\n\nThe ambiance had its ups and downs. It felt a bit louder than I‚Äôd expect for a higher-end restaurant, especially when we first walked in, but it settled down as the evening went on. It‚Äôs a great spot for a dinner date, with a cozy atmosphere once things quiet down.\n\nOverall, I came in with high expectations after reading other reviews and hearing great things, but while the experience was good, it left me wanting a bit more. It‚Äôs a solid choice, just not quite as magical as I had hoped.', 'Worth every penny!!! Make sure to book reservations far far in advance. Service was wonderful but the food was even better. Definitely in our top 5 meals of all time. Salad was great with a super fun presentation. For the sides we tried the creamed spinach and the creamed corn. Creamed corn was good, but that creamed spinach was amazing! Had no idea creamed spinach could taste like that. Best piece of prime rib we‚Äôve ever eaten hands down. They do one thing and they do that one thing well! Atmosphere was really fun. Cool to see them cutting your meat. There was several birthdays that night and everyone in the room sang. We also ended up chatting with the parties to either side of us and they were great too. If you go to San Francisco you need to go here.', 'Overall very good experience at the House of Prime Rib. Food and service were excellent. Our party had the standard (House of Prime Rib) cut and the bigger (King Henry VIII) cut. They will sear the bigger cut upon request- tasted great!

The service was outstanding, making our special occasion feel even more exceptional. The prime rib was delicious‚Äîperfectly cooked and full of flavor. A big thank you to the staff for such attentive service. Highly recommend for a memorable dining experience!"", 'My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday dinner and it was an amazing dining experience!\n\nFood: LOVE the salad. Really wanna learn the recipe of the dressing. City cut is already big enough of a portion for me. I heard afterwards that we can actually get another same dish for free but we didn‚Äôt know it at the moment.\nThe rib is fresh and juicy. I ordered medium rare with baked potato, and cream spinach. Perfect combo! I prefer the original gravy instead of the sauce they offered.\n\nService: the staff is very friendly and warm. They served multiple tables so sometimes it‚Äôs hard to get their attention when they‚Äôre serving the salad, which is freshly made at table side.\n\nAmbiance: the seats deep in the restaurant has a more traditional formal dining vibe and as well as the round tables.

Wayfare Tavern,4.5,2618.0,"[""I first visited Wayfare Tavern in 2019 while in San Francisco for work, and it quickly became a favorite.

This cozy little restaurant oozes with ambiance. Think warm wood, a staircase at the entrance, rich colored fabrics, and I haven‚Äôt even gotten to the food. You‚Äôll need a reservation. We were extremely late for ours so we had to sit at the little bar upstairs. It would have been beyond perfect if the barstools had had backs. There is something on the menu for everyone. Fish, seafood, chicken, beef, vegetarian, all are options. Notice the rolls so hot they emit steam when you break them apart. They are kind of like a fluffy sourdough. Very important: leave room for dessert. Even if you just had the steamy rolls and dessert, your life would be complete. The service was great!', ""Went on a Saturday night.  Great lively atmosphere.  Nice decor, wood and brass.  Counter seating at the bar and in front of open kitchen.  We sat upstairs and it was a bit warm and loud... Couple of overly loud people who thought screaming at the person across the table was necessary.  We ordered a lemon drop martini and a Moscow mule.  Both were very good.  For dinner we had the fried chicken and burrata whipped potatoes... Both were excellent.  Have to still get used to the San Francisco tax (6%) that's added on to the bill.  Not a big menu but would definitely go back."", ""We recently dined at Wayfare Tavern, and while the food and atmosphere were fantastic, our server seemed to be having an off day and wasn't very attentive.

Overall, it's a great spot for a meal, and we‚Äôll definitely return for the food and ambiance."", 'I attended my company party on the 4th floor of the restaurant. The place was very cozy.

Plow,4.5,2483.0,"[""Definitely worth the wait! We walked around and enjoyed the rest of the neighborhood before our table was ready. The outside parklet seating was perfect for bringing our dog. The service was great, folks were friendly and happy. Best of all was that the food lives up to expectations! The Biscuit with honey butter is very satisfying. And the Plow let's us try a bit of a lot of things- the homemade pork sausage was some of the best breakfast sausage we've ever had. The potatoes were so skillfully made, crispy for some bits, but not burnt and with the right amount of herbs and seasonings. The lemon ricotta pancakes were also deceptively airy and the right balance of lemon flavor making it delicious even without syrup!

When i arrived, i noticed that the theme and vibe was very cozy. Service was exceptional even though they had a full house. I ordered their own ‚Äúthe plow‚Äù dish. I would give a 5 star but the food did not live up to the billing and the presentation was misaligned with the sub par taste of the food. The coffee was great and i loved how the food was cooked in an open kitchen concept.', ""Huh... People line up for this place? I'm glad we went on a weekday when there was no wait. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with potatoes and a side of pork sausage, and I tried a pancake from my companion's plate. Breakfast sandwich was forgettable; I could've made that at home. Potatoes were burnt. Sausage was mediocre at best, and certainly didn't live up to its price tag. The pancakes were unpleasantly dense and too heavy on the lemon. Even the coffee was so-so. Service was fine. Overall, I'm not sure why we paid so much for this, but you won't catch me making that same mistake again.""]"

I feel strongly that the quality of the food is of the utmost importance but the presentation here truly elevates great food to make it a special occasion. If you would like to explore the classic juxtaposition of crunch and soft the chicken and waffle has no equal.

A bar setup in the room ensured attentive service. The meal was a set menu, and I opted for the salmon as my main course. While it was perfectly cooked, it lacked flavor. The crispy Brussels sprout chips were excellent, especially when paired with alcoholic drinks. The deviled egg, topped with a small piece of jalape√±o and bacon, was unremarkable and not spicy.

Me and my friend ordered Mortadella and Duck Prosciutto along with their sourdough bread and butter for $7.  The sourdough was perfect - spongy on the inside and a thin dense caramelized rustic crust.  The mortadella was a bit heavy on salt but once I sampled it with some pickled vegetables, it cancelled out the salt and left the flavor of the meat and pimento.

Yes, you are reading that right, $58 to dine at a two-Michelin star restaurant. This does not include drinks, and I would call this more of a snack rather than a full meal.

It was an excellent contrast from the outside which includes a bit of gritty downtown street scene. I say this as someone who sees this as a recent arrival from SoCal suburbia.

It might have been posted I  just didn't notice it. This tax is the Employee Health Care SF. How fair is that? What the employer is responsible for his employees can be tagged on to the customer.

Overall the fettuccini was phenomenal. Clearly freshly made and had good springiness complimented by the sauce of garlic, onions and cream.  The Gnocchi was just okay. the pasta was a bit doughy feeling and stuck to my teeth as you chewed.  the basil cream sauce was great though and so we did not leave any behind!\nThe chicken was also superb.  Good flavors and texture and just a perfect complement to the rest of the meal.\nWe wish we had room for dessert as the looked phenomenal but we ate our dessert in the additional pasta order!', 'This place was amazing.

A great option if you are attending a show at the Paramount.', 'The appetizer was pretty good but simple.  I had a conversation about deciding between the Salmon and the Pork Chop and told the waitress that I really only like salmon raw but when cooked it should not be over cooked.  It was not red at all.  Totally white and has little to no seasoning.  Now the mushrooms on the plate were spectacular.  The halibut was pretty good but some of the asparagus was cut a little close to the stem and made for some bitter bites.  Kitchen may just be off their game.  Dunno.  Too expensive for not top notch quality.  The waitress did offer to recook the salmon but honestly we were half way through the meal.  So I will give her 5 stars.', 'Not sure why it says ‚Äúfine dining‚Äù - it‚Äôs not. Though upscale restaurant overall. Menu is mediterranean. Service is friendly.\nThe food did not fully convince.

The service was amazing, same with the ambiance. I got the Buttermilk Oatmeal Pancakes and the Hot Chocolate and it was very good. The Oatmeal Buttermilk Pancakes comes with a berry infused butter, cherries, a chopped up chalk bread (I forgot the name), and Maple Syrup. The Hot Chocolate has foam and a heart design on it and was very good. I would go again!', 'What can I say. Great service and delicious offerings. From their wine to their smaller plates.

I'd recommend the indigo gin one."", 'A very unfortunate breakfast:  a plate of French toast and sweet sausage which actually was very good. French toast ($19) was difficult to eat. The bread was crusty and a pain to cut with a butter knife.  Pancakes were extremely plain with the sweet sausage for $22.   A little bit of fruit would have justified the price but this was awful.  There was no creativity at all. After one pancake,  I gave up. It was lacking an edible taste.   If you are a tourist, walk a few blocks on 4th or Olive Way. I am sure you will find a better breakfast  experience somewhere else.', 'One place you must try if your in town is Lola. Their food is amazing. I do recommend to make a reservation, if not you will wait about 20-30min. The wait was worth it.\nWe had the octopus (rare mixture of flavors)- the octopus is fresh, soft and crunchy at the same time. We also tried the tomato casserole- this is big and delicious.

The food was above average, with the octopus hash standing out as a unique dish. The potatoes, bacon, and sausages were well-prepared and enjoyable.

I highly recommend making a reservation as space seems to fill up quickly here. We selected an early dinner time and were seated promptly. Service was fast and attentive and the food good. My partner had the ravioli and I had the chicken, and later for desert, tried the olive oil cake. It was very good! The prices are a bit high for my liking though.

There were many others dressed the same way. $ spends the same. :)"", ""I have great things to say about Tulio except one thing. Great ambiance, amazing service and a really great experience. I went on a date night and they gave us a complementary champagne. I would call that great hosting. Our waiter was sweet, the food was tasty, and the ambiance was really vibrant.\n\nThe only thing which I felt a bit underwhelming was the portion size. I think they could increase portion size a bit. We tried sweet potato gnocchi and Ravioli and we felt the portion size of both of them was too small.

We visited the Space Needle, which was very close by, right before dinner. One thing I don‚Äôt particularly like is when restaurants have a common entrance with a hotel because you have to ask for directions, which feels awkward to me. Unfortunately, this was one of those places. However, the front desk staff were very polite and respectfully guided us to the correct location.\n\nWe didn't make a reservation, but it was a Monday, so it wasn‚Äôt a problem. We didn't get a table with a view, but the restaurant is quite spacious overall.\n\nThe food was excellent, though the prices are definitely on the higher side.

It was such a wonderful experience. We had a great selection of oysters, crisp, and veggies. The oysters were so fresh and I enjoyed the many varieties (and I don‚Äôt even like oysters all that much). They have an open kitchen and a warm aesthetic, so it feels very small format and homey.

Super loud and uncomfortable seats.\n\nOysters are mid‚Ä¶ :/ ribs are cold when they were served . I found sardine interesting . They did not have any trout Menu.

Walking down a strangely empty long hallway, we eventually made it to the waiting area. The lady that greeted us was very friendly and added us to the wait list, as there are no reservations.\nThe seating is VERY cramped and loud, be prepared for loudness and close proximity to the party adjacent to you.\nWe started with Ben's Bread, the rye was delicious, but the flakes of salt in the butter were incredibly overpowering.\nThen came out the oysters, our waiter helped us decide which ones to order and what to expect. They were delicious, although I wish other dishes made it out at the same time so that we could have a pallet cleanser.\nThe next dish was Billy's tomatoes... Incredibly delicious heirloom tomatoes with an anchovy dill sauce that was amazing.\nThe clams were also delicious, unfortunately we had a good amount of empty clams--not found in the bottom of the dish, kind of sad\nThe nectarine dessert was tasty and a very fitting dish to end the night, it had a very underwhelming amount of nectarines, but it was a very nice light dessert to finish with.\nOverall, loved the staff, food was pretty delicious, but it was very loud and cramped.

Terra Plata,4.2,1417.0,"['All around one of the best dining experiences in Seattle. The service was absolutely unmatched, the bartender was amazing and overall the staff went above and beyond. The food was very well done and the sizing shareable. We always get multiple things for the table to try. You need to order the chips and French dip appetizer, but the Wagyu Beef and Portuguese Pig were the show stoppers our of the night. This is a great summer spot and we would definitely come back.', 'First time in Seattle and we decided to check out Terra Plata for one of our nice dinners out. The place, the service, and the atmosphere were incredible! We ordered a lot of items to share and really enjoyed most of them. The only reason I took a star off is because the salmon was undercooked, and the churros were very doughy. Other than that, I would definitely come back to try more of their menu items. Starbucks Reserve is also next door, so you can always walk over and end the night with an espresso martini.', 'I like this restaurant the patio is amazing and they also have heaters to keep you warm in cold Seattle weather, they have Seawolf bread and locally sourced ingredients.

We were seated, and no one came by to check in or acknowledge or even give water. By the time the waitress finally managed to come over, we ordered immediately. They brought out appetizer with some of the main course. And brought one dish so late we were mostly done with food by the time the last dish arrived. The waitress never came by to check in on food or us. The food taste is decent, but definitely not worth what you pay for. There's plenty of other restaurants nearby with same price and better service. Don't waste your time or money here"", 'The first thing I said when walking into this establishment was that not having any A/C told me everything I needed to know, and I wish I would have left right then and there and chose somewhere else to dine. Besides not having any A/C, the water that is served is not even cold and contains absolutely no ice. I am 34 weeks pregnant and was very uncomfortable the entire time (it was 86 degrees still at 7:30pm). The  hibiscus soda was good and was nice to help cool down. Our waitress/server was friendly and recommended a few dishes to us. The baguette with the oil was the best item ordered. The albacore was tasty but for $25 I felt like it was certainly overpriced. I ordered the burger, which was not the best, strange flavor, and didn‚Äôt taste like a burger at all. And finally, I had the Paella Marisco which was not that great, either. The shrimp was probably the only good tasting item from this dish, the saffron rice was very disappointing. For dessert, I ordered the churros which I thought surely these will be good at least but nope, they were very soft on the inside like dough. The real kicker though was being approached after paying to ask to leave a tip. My partner went to pay with his credit card and was planning to leave cash on the table which is a pretty common occurrence, I could not believe it. I always tip at least 10% when dining out even when the food/service isn‚Äôt that great. I can‚Äôt believe the lady had the audacity to approach us asking for a tip (this was the hostess I believe and not our server). We explained we were going to leave the tip in cash but after this happened we decided not to tip at all. There are better restaurants around the area, unfortunately we won‚Äôt be back here.']"

I‚Äôm fine with the automatic 20% service charge. What I‚Äôm not fine with is the addition of language ‚Äútips appreciated but not expected‚Äù. If you as a restaurant are taking a stand against tipping culture by tacking on an automatic service charge to provide your servers a decent wage, it should be your policy not to accept tips. It makes for an awkward situation having received great service, to then leave no gratuity. We left an additional $20, but were left with an icky feeling. Despite the fantastic meal, I‚Äôd think twice before coming back.', ""Beautiful location, ordered 42 Ribeye for pick up through Uber Eats, they let me wait in the lobby since I got there early.  They even said I could sit somewhere but I didn't feel that was necessary.  Cool photo collection of famous customers and interesting display of meats.  The garlic mash that came with my steak was otherworldly, can't figure out what they do to make it so good.  The steak smelled amazing but it did get less hot by the time I got home, ordered it rare and it was perfect.  The flavor was very good but my boyfriend makes us steak that he dry brines with Montreal seasoning which just takes it to a whole other level.  I missed that seasoning somehow.

Elliott's Oyster House,4.3,6228.0,"['First off sat at a high table in the walk way next to extremely noisy bar area and next to an open door to the patio. It was freezing so it was difficult to enjoy anything.  It was so noisy I gave up trying to have a conversation with my husband.  The meal started off great due to what turned out to be the best part of the experience- the non alcoholic bubbly was delicious as was the appetizer- mushroom strudel with fig sauce.  It went downhill from there the clam chowder was salty and the texture was weird the potato‚Äôs had the tiny cubed consistency of canned hash and the clams were extinct or as elusive as big foot.  I ordered the halibut fish and chips - very disappointing- thin as cardboard, old tasting and again super salty and dry - did not taste at all like halibut which is a firm but moist and delicate white fish which is usually THICK - this was brownish grey.  My husband had the king crab which was lack luster in both size and taste. All in all a big disappointment.  We are from the east side and look forward to Seattles seafood.  We have been to Elliot‚Äôs several times over the years and this will be the last.\nAfter receiving the check I realized the area was so noisy it also affected the server‚Äôs ability to hear as although I pointed to the halibut on the ‚Äúdaily specials menu‚Äù he placed the order for cod and chips so at least I was charged only $24 instead of $48 for the thin dry salty fish and burnt oily fries.', 'First time to Seattle and our group of 4 wanted to go to a seafood restaurant to eat oysters so we decided on this place after a long day walking around Seattle sightseeing.\n\nEven though it was the weekend, we were seated quickly and ordered drinks before we sampled the various oysters from the menu.\n\nLocated on the waterfront, it is a tourist trap with great views but hey, you only live once. They have a great selection of oysters from around Washington, and the waiter gave us some tips and described each very well.\n\nDecided also to try their fish and chips, which was really good also.

If I could go back and re-do this meal, I would have asked for 5 orders of the ribs with a bowl of rice and been so very happy. I initially went for their soup dumplings but now that is no longer the case. I would go back for these ribs. The pork dumplings were better than their new chicken ones and all the rest of the dumplings were good. The biggest disappointment were the Noodles with beef and peppers. I did not like this at all. Obviously we all have our preferences but I did not like the flavors but to make it worse, the noodles were very soft, like they were over cooked and/or sitting in liquid way to long. I would recommend the chocolate mochi and the black sesame for dessert. Both were delicious."", 'So I went to Seattle for work and my co workers said that they have good dumplings here.

Maximilien Restaurant,4.3,1191.0,"['Decided to give this place a try while on vacation! First impression was lovely, was greeted warmly and the host was able to accommodate us even though we arrived 20 minutes prior to our reservation. A ton of people were out on the patio but we chose to be seated inside and it was like we had our own private space! Very lovely view of the bay. Our server was super sweet too with each interaction. The baguette was nice and fresh, and I wish I could buy the sea salt butter they had by the pound! For my main course I ordered King Salmon and in all honesty I was a bit disappointed as it was pretty dry. The potato‚Äôs and veg that were served with it however was really flavorful though especially with the sauce that was plated with it. Dessert was also ok, but aside from the pretty plating it wasn‚Äôt anything to write home about really. I‚Äôd be interested in coming again, but would definitely need to order something different I feel.', ""I recently had the pleasure of celebrating a birthday at Maximilien and it was a wonderful experience. With reservations on a Monday evening it ensured we were promptly seated by the window, offering stunning views of the sound. The ambiance was warm and inviting, setting the perfect tone for a celebration. We started with cocktails that were expertly crafted, setting the stage for what turned out to be an exceptional dining experience our favorites were the Spritz and the Mule. The lamb and ahi tuna dishes were absolute standouts, cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor. Need to call out the butter that was served with the bread it was a 10/10. To make the celebration special a surprise profiterole arrived at our table, a delightful surprise that we couldn't resist ordering more of. Parking was easy as it was a week night and the market had closed. We felt fortunate to have chosen a weekday evening for our visit, avoiding the usual crowds and making our experience even more enjoyable. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or simply craving exceptional cuisine, I would highly recommend. We'll definitely be back."", 'We wanted to try something new. They have outside seating and we were able to enjoy the cool air off the water. My wife and I both had a salad. I had the soup of the day which was chowder and she had french fries. Everything was phenomenal. The only thing that I would change was that the salad had thick blue cheese crumbles, which was a little too much. We also had to ask for another side of dressing. But nothing that would not make us go there again. I highly recommend. The server was phenomenal as well.', 'Authentic and solid French cuisine right on the water! I came here solo for a quick dinner and was seared outside on the patio overlooking a perfect sunset. The team was attentive, efficient and helpful with menu suggestions. Great spot to enjoy a dinner al fresco!', ""Went here for a special occasion. We were on time, but this restaurant has a $30 cancelation fee and you must add a credit card for a reservation. I don't like this at all and haven't experienced it before. They only hold your table for 10 minutes and wouldn't seat my date while I parked (Pike Place Market so not easy to find parking). I felt the ordeal to book a reservation, get seated and put a credit card on file was absurd. While I understand people flake on a reservation often,  I think only holding a table for 10 minutes should suffice, the rest is ridiculous.\nNow, our server was very sweet and knowledgeable about the menu, a young woman named Grace. She immediately brought over sparkling rose for our date, which was lovely and was nice to be remembered on our reservation. I ordered the foie gras but was disappointed because it was a slice of liver versus pate that Im used to, the photo on the menu on the website looked like a delicious piece of pate and I booked the restaurant for this meal so that was a big disappointment. My date ordered escargot for the table, was delicious! Perfectly cooked. My date had the duck leg confit with lentils and a bowl of French onion soup-I tried the soup, it was the best I've ever had. The view was amazing of Puget Sound, the service was very good (except the seating bit) and the food was good and what i expected for the most part.""]"
Ivar's Acres of Clams,4.4,7965.0,"[""I've eaten here twice in the past with coworkers during business trips, and I was thrilled to be able to finally go again with family. We went during the dinner rush on a Friday night so we had to wait a bit to be seated. The restaurant was more crowded than I've seen it at any other time I've gone, but service was still surprisingly prompt. I ordered the Seafood Mixed Trio, though it was a tough choice because so many things on the menu sounded amazing. The dish was a little different than the last time I ordered it (hadn't been there in 5 years) but it was still delicious. The atmosphere in the restaurant is fantastic as well; it's kind of cozy and rustic, and it's great to sit there enjoying good food and watching the ferries and boats on the water just outside.\n\nWe came back the following night and got food from Ivar's Fish Bar outside the main restaurant; it's more of a casual fish-and-chips place. I had a really hard time deciding between the chowder and bread bowl or the clam strips, but eventually settled on the latter. They were delicious, as were the fries, especially with Ivar's own tartar sauce.\n\nCan't wait to eat here again and try something new!"", 'Beautiful and delicious with great service! My aunt and uncle from Tacoma chose this place as it is a longtime favorite of theirs. They drove up to meet us for lunch when we were in town. The location was great - only a few short blocks from our hotel and the views were beautiful. We had a window seat overlooking the water.\n\nWhile I enjoy many types of fish I  allergic to shellfish. Our server was great about answering my questions and making sure what I ordered was prepared safely for me. I am glad we had reservations as I watched the place fill up around us. It was a wonderful place for our lunch!', ""Ivar's is famous within the Northwest, so no surprise we had an approximate 35 minute wait for an available table. They do support text messaging when your table is ready; but luckily, we were in the waiting room 10 minutes before because we never received the text before our name was called.\n\nWe ordered a Blackened Salmon Ceasar ($32), Seafood Rice ($43), and Ivar's famous Clam Chowder ($10 bowl). The chowder was outstanding while the salmon and seafood rice were very good. Service was very good too. We also really liked the restaurant decor."", 'Beautiful and spacious restaurant, regular food a bit expensive for the quality. We went to eat here after an aquarium visit, it was a nice walk and the best option around for seafood. If you go at peak hours have to wait to be seated but they have a seating area to wait.  We ordered clam chowder and a ciopino, the clam chowder was too salty and quite expensive for the small cup. The ciopino had a lot of fish, was tasty and well cooked but too little clams and mussels. The inside of the restaurant is nice, it has a wonderful view to the sea and the decoration is beautiful. Bathrooms were clean', 'Mixed feelings about this place. The portions were generous and the food was good, but not spectacular. The restaurant itself is huge but was running at half speed, with a one hour long wait for walk-ins but plenty of empty tables. Service was mediocre; both the hostess and our server were snappy, not very professional or patient. We asked a few questions about the menu and how items were prepared, and the answers were always exasperated and short. We also tried to to-go  portion of the restaurant before boarding a ferry, and even though the chowder and fish & chips were delicious, service was terrible. Inpatient and rude staff at the ordering window, with a lot of messed up orders and customers complaining of overcharges. It happened to us and we were told we would get a refund, but no receipt was provided.']"
El Gaucho Seattle,4.6,1750.0,"['Phenomenal restaurant with excellent service and exquisite menu. Definitely recommend reservations.

Will definitely be back when I am in Seattle again.', 'If you seek exquisite food, outstanding service, and a romantic atmosphere, this is undoubtedly the place to go. During our visit to Seattle, we gathered with friends for an early birthday dinner. The staff at El Gaucho went above and beyond to make me feel celebrated, beginning with a personalized birthday card signed by the team. We kicked off the evening with craft cocktails and a dozen oysters, which were absolutely exceptional. The meal continued with a delightful red wine paired with our bone-in ribeye and sides. To top it all off, the live piano performance was a lovely addition; the pianist even played a birthday song as they served a delicious key lime pie! Overall, it was a truly five-star experience!', 'Everything about this restaurant is top notch. The food, service, and ambience are all outstanding. We went for our anniversary and the entire staff made our experience feel very personal and special. From customized menus congratulating us on the occasion, to rose pedals spread across the table, every single part of the dinner was executed to perfection. Our server Jimmy as well as the manager Kirin went above and beyond as well to ensure a great experience. If you are looking for a place to celebrate a special occasion I can not recommend El Gaucho enough!', 'The staff and food are next level. We were celebrating and they had covered our table in rose petals. Our server made the experience one for the books. The steaks were incredible and the drinks and desert were delicious. Definitely will return when in Seattle.', 'The food was absolutely amazing! The steak and lobster was flavorful and the baste and crust of the steak crispy and nice. The fried calamari was delicious and so were the fries and mushrooms. The only thing that wasn‚Äôt good was the wedge salad. It had a weird taste but I others probably enjoy the blue cheese, it just wasn‚Äôt for us. Loved the complementary bread and the drinks were well crafted. Definitely recommend!']"

SUPERB SERVICE.', ""My family and I recently dined at Assaggio Restaurant, and we were thoroughly impressed by both the service and the food. Despite it being a crowded Wednesday evening, our waiter was incredibly attentive, ensuring we had a pleasant experience. My husband and son ordered the Bolognese with added meatballs, and both enjoyed their meal immensely. I opted for the Fusilli, adding mushrooms and no meat, and the flavors were rich and delightful.To finish off our meal, we had the gelato and Tiramisu. Both desserts were soft and delightful, a perfect end to our meal. Overall, Assaggio's provided a wonderful dining experience, and we would definitely come back again."", 'Classic and classy located on 4th St.  Friendly and knowledgeable staff always help you have a great experience.

If you're used to their other restaurants like Ba Bar it's pretty much the same vibe."", ""A few, very minor dislikes which may be a one off or not their fault. The vibe was super chill so you can't expect a quiet atmosphere in thr lounge. Dining looked nice for a date night, but a friend's food date, the lounge was perfect. Small bites were perfect servings and dessert was nice to top it off, washing it down with a non alcoholic Peach Fizz. I had some juicy, but crispy, tenderloin wraps as well. They were a balance of deliciousness"", 'It was the first time in my life when I tried a Vietnamese cuisine and I liked it. Restaurant is very clean and spacious, it also has a nice summer terrace, which is great when the weather is so nice as it was today.

The ravioli and the whole trout are just awesome!! The best little yummy ravioli that I have ever had. The whole trout is so fresh and delicious.

Lucky to grab an outdoor seating around 8 pm on a Friday, would be a 30 min for indoor seating. The service was stellar. Food was amazing, so much flavor and unique tasting dips that paired so well with their warm pita bread. The roasted chicken was crisp and flavorful. Ice cream tasted like a dole whip which was nice! I‚Äôd come back!', 'Homer is an absolute gem! The uniqueness of each dish blew us away. Everything is cooked over a wood fire, which enriches the flavors. Yes, the wait on a Saturday was long, but worth every minute. The wahl grazing lamb is pretty fatty / heavy but rich. Go for the side of whipped garlic to add to the pita. Can‚Äôt wait to return and share this experience with friends! Also, Milk Drunk is their sister restaurant right down the street. So can‚Äôt go wrong with the soft serve window while waiting.', ""A friend suggested this restaurant, and it did not disappoint. Though there might be a wait, it's absolutely worth it.

The chanterelle mushrooms, the onion soubise, and the pine nuts were great. The black cod (sub for monkfish) and the huckleberry tart were good.\n\nHowever,\n-  One of our grilled hamachi was still frozen in the middle. (And we both thought the grill char overpowered the fish)\n- One of the falafel was still uncooked in the middle.\n- The duck breast was quite tough, and hard to cut and hard to chew.\n- Both desserts were good, but the ricotta was bland. I tasted no lemon. It could use a syrup.\n- I also ordered the NA drink pairing. And honestly it was disappointing to not love a single one of them. They were all sour and/or bitter. One of them was like ‚Äòdestroy your mouth‚Äô bitter.\n\n(Visited the 24th, since the menu changes)', 'Finally come to Copine!

In particular we love the foie preparations, soups, and the attention to presentation and detail seldom found at other high end restaurants in Seattle. This is not rustic cuisine and we like that. Highly recommended.', 'We have been to Copine a couple of times and it is a good experience. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I am vegan and they have the chef prepare special courses based on the fresh ingredients they have, which I greatly appreciate.

The atmosphere feels reminiscent to quaint restaurants in Paris and is matched by friendly service.\n\nThe food has always been stellar, offering several signature dishes that are consistently good every time. The couscous salad, country pork terrine, and charcuterie boards make great appetizers alongside the complimentary baguette and butter.\n\nEnjoy your meal alongside a classic cocktail, high quality wine, or a crisp Kronenbourg beer. Steak frites, fish of the day, and duck confit have remained my favorites and are always delicious and cooked to perfection.\n\nLe Pichet will always be a favorite Seattle restaurant of mine that brings nostalgic memories of eating here throughout my life.', 'This is a lovely little French bistro not far from the Pike Street Market. It is small, so it has a very intimate feel.\n\nI started with a lovely cocktail of gin and grapefruit. Very light and fresh. I followed with the chicken liver terrine. It was served with an excellent baguette. It was a very smooth mousse, and was a lovely version of the classic dish.\n\nFor my entree I had the black cod, which was perfectly cooked. It was served in a heavily fennel tasting broth served with carrots, fennel, and artichoke. I found the broth to be a bit too sour and ""fennel"" heavy for the very light cod flavor, but it was tasty nonetheless.\n\nThe have a huge selection of cheese and charcuterie, which you can get on very good bread as an open faced sandwich.\n\nThe service was excellent.\n\nThey offer a small selection of desserts, although I did not try one.\n\nAll in all, it is a lovely place for a calm, bistro-style meal.']"
Matt's in the Market,4.5,1095.0,"[""I love Matt's in the Market: I feel like it's a uniquely Seattle place, nestled in a little corner overlooking Pike Place Market, with views of the activity below, the iconic market neon sign, and Puget Sound. It's always lively, and the service is superb and friendly, whether at a bar or at a table.\n\nI feel like lunch is the best option here. I like the extra hubbub of the market, and though still spendy for a lunch, think that the lunch menu presents a better value than the dinner menu. I usually get one of the sandwiches when I have lunch here and have always enjoyed them‚Äîespecially the crab roll I had recently. I like the deviled egg assortment, as well, and if you're into desserts, they are worth trying. Most recently I had a deliciously decadent chocolate gelato.\n\nFor dinner, I like the starter plates‚Äîthe oysters are solid, and a small cheese plate (three cheeses) was a wonderful way to start off a dinner, split between two people. The entrees seemed excessively priced to me, and on my most recent visit, came out lukewarm. I understand that things happen in a busy kitchen, and I'd never otherwise experienced a fault like this, but it was enough to leave me with some mixed feelings about a $150/person dinner.\n\nRegardless, I still find Matt's a local gem and a great place to take out-of-towners for a memorable meal when they visit. I'll return anytime, including for dinner if the occasion calls for it, but lunch will probably remain my sweet spot."", 'Absolutely great food!

The Carlile Room,4.4,857.0,"['We showed up early for our reservation and only had to wait several minutes to be seated. Very organic friendly interaction, not forced or patronizing. The whole meal was seamless, from drinks to the check. The Skagit Valley Chicken Schnitzel was unexpected with yuzu vinaigrette, and it totally works. The Bucatini Amatriciana was excellent, with a kick that lingered, so be prepared. I have to say bucatini pasta is no my favorite. Chewy and a perfect medium to hold the sauce. Cheesy Asian pear with in house made focaccia was perfect. The menu seems to change so no worry about running out of options. We will return. And you should, too, after the first time.', 'The Carlile Room in Seattle is an outstanding dining spot that offers a delightful experience. I decided to try their hamburger, and it turned out to be an excellent choice.\n\nHighlights:\n\n‚Ä¢\tFood Quality: The hamburger and fries were delicious. Despite being a seemingly simple dish, few places manage to get it right, and Carlile Room excels in this regard. The flavors were spot-on, and every bite was satisfying.\n‚Ä¢\tService: The attention from the staff was incredible. They were attentive without being overbearing, allowing me to enjoy my meal in peace. This balance contributed significantly to the overall positive experience.\n‚Ä¢\tAmbiance: The atmosphere is warm and inviting. The cozy setting, combined with tasteful decor, made for a comfortable dining environment. It‚Äôs located in a great part of Seattle, which adds to its charm.\n‚Ä¢\tMenu: Although the menu isn‚Äôt extensive, each option is well-curated. The limited selection ensures that each dish is a good choice, making it easier to decide what to order.\n\nConclusion:\nDining at the Carlile Room was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.

The attention to detail in both food and service makes it a highly recommended spot in Seattle. I look forward to returning and exploring more of their menu.', ""The Carlile Room was a fantastic experience from start to finish! The service was top-notch, attentive and friendly, which created a fun and enjoyable atmosphere. But let's talk about the food! The beef wagyu - absolutely incredible.

We were finally seated along the waterfront windows and were served by Eli. Our experience lifted off from there. He answered our questions and made suggestions. The oysters were fresh and good. I opted for the new 3 course menu. The salads happily came on chilled plates. My blue cheese and almond salad and my wife's grilled watermelon salad were both excellent! Grilled American Wagyu Sirloin for me and crab legs for my wife. Eli went above and beyond by putting on gloves and completely opened the crab legs for my wife! The molten chocolate cake rounded things off. Overall wonderful experience and ELI, YOU'RE THE BOMB!!"", ""If you're looking for some fresh, delicious seafood, then go no further.

I went a few times to try out different seafood dishes. I found the shrimp/steak a bit disappointing. The steak pieces were very small and overcooked, so very chewy.  The crab stuffed fish was ok but would have preferred the fish not be fried with a coating. A high-quality fish tastes good on its own without needing frying.\nAs for desserts, they were okay but small and not worth the $12 price tag.  The main dishes were $40-$50, which is on the high end.', 'Cutters is a great venue, beautiful glass windows to view the bay while you eat.\n\nHowever the food was a mixed bag, definitely do not order the fried misto, the calamari were overcooked, shrunk and all you could taste was the batter.

Joule,4.5,936.0,"['We were surprised after leaving this restaurant and learning that it had multiple James beard award nominations. We were not impressed. For starters, I think there‚Äôs a naming issue both for the restaurant and some of the dishes. There were only a quarter of the dishes on the menu that were reminiscent of Korean food, so it shouldn‚Äôt be considered Korean fusion in my book. There was more Chinese and definitely some Japanese on the menu.
