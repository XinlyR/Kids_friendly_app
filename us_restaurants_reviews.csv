The Modern,4.6,2307,"['Simply exceptional in every category. This was one of the few experiences where I didn\'t provide any constructive feedback at the end of my visit.\n\nSam, Isabel and Gabe (and the entire team) provided a comfortably elegant experience. Seated at a table overlooking the courtyard I was able to view the entire dining area as well as hear the beautiful energy coming from the Bar Room.\n\nAfter a brief consult with Sam we opted for ""Abstractions"" with the paired wines. This turned out to be an exceptional choice.\n\nEvery dish and every wine proved to be a beautiful symphony of flavors - simply sensory perfection.', 'What an incredible and unforgettable dining experience at The Modern. From the moment I walked in, I was warmly welcomed and made to feel like the only guest in the entire restaurant. The level of service was exceptional, with every detail attended to with care and attention. Despite my dietary restrictions, the staff ensured that the tasting menu was safe for me and tailored to my needs.\n\nAs for the food, it was truly exceptional. Each dish from the tasting menu was perfectly portioned and impeccably presented. The duck and the cheesecake ice cream were standout highlights from the Impressions menu. Every bite was a burst of flavor and creativity. The experience was well worth the investment, and the opportunity to dine inside the MoMa only added to the overall enchanting ambiance.', 'I booked the Kitchen Table and it was an incredible experience. The food was absolutely amazing and you left feeling full but not stuffed. The atmosphere was very fun and it was unique to see all the chefs in action. This experience was worth every penny and was right up there with any 3 Michelin Starred restaurant. The staff made us feel very comfortable and it was a very enjoyable experience. We had dietary restrictions and they were able to accommodate with ease! If you are able to get a reservation for the Kitchen Table or the dining room for the tasting menu while in NYC, do yourself a favor and book it!', 'Eggs on eggs on eggs was worth the hype, easily one of my favorite dishes in recent memory. Other than the duck dish (fell flat), everything was to our liking. Cocktails were delicious, especially the espresso martini. We had an early reservation and the restaurant was fairly empty but filled in part way through. Part of the meal was done outside in the garden which was nice.', ""This place is phenomenal. Service is top notch and has a very elegant atmosphere.\n\nReservation: fairly easy. I managed to make the dinner reservation for the same day.\n\nFood: it's spring menu during my visit. everything is nearly perfect. It started with eggs on eggs on eggs, which is their signature. The first bite was unforgettable but I continued, I found it a little too salty. The other dishes are impressive, but not innovative. I wish the flavors and combinations have more surprises. To be honest , food alone is not worth Michelin 2 stars.\n\nI was told that the menu doesn't alter too much over the years. I probably won't come back.""]"
Gramercy Tavern,4.6,4066,"['We had a fabulous meal, everything was delicious! We loved the dips so much we ordered a second round. The oysters were the best! And of course, the chocolate chip cookie for dessert! Highly recommend everything. Also, the service was great and Alicia took excellent care of us and we had fun with her! Definitely recommend!', 'I came here for a birthday celebration. The food was good but not outstanding.  Their service was just ok. After serving each dish, they did not even bother to ask how s the taste of the dish. I guess they either were confident that customer would like the dishes or the restaurant did not care of their customers.  Their dessert was quite disappointing, they were too sweet.\n\nI think I would not go back there again.', ""Came for their dining room menu. We got one of each things on the menu. Everything was delicious and so special. I loved the carrot, cabbage, and raviolis. They gave us a carrot cake since we're here for a small celebration and two lemon poppy seed pound cakes to go. Overall, this is one of my favorites restaurants in NYC! Would definitely come back here again!"", ""Went to this restaurant for restaurant week. Definitely great value at that price! The lumache was one of the best dishes I've had in NYC. Staff is also very friendly and cool decor. Also good free bread.\n\nI do think the desserts however need improvement. They were too sweet and did not feel elevated compared to the other items."", 'The environment is charming and delightful. Service is exceptional, with a friendliness that surpasses typical Michelin restaurants, making the experience feel more genuine. I tried the lunch menu during Restaurant Week, and the dishes were incredible. The hanger steak was tender and full of flavor, and the desserts and appetizers were well-balanced and light. Highly recommend giving it a try!']"
Carmine's,4.5,16612,"[""This place came highly recommended. We made reservations for 6 pm. Crowds were waiting outside. Once we got in we were told they were running behind. We didn't get seated until 6:30. Unfortunately we got seated at a busy spot and all evening long I kept getting my seat bumped. Our waiter brought over a basket of bread plus two glasses of prosecco for our anniversary dinner. Our waiter was very helpful in advising us on what to order. He recommended chicken marsala over spaghetti, just one order to split. It turned out the plate could have fed four people. It was good. The portion size makes up for the expensive dish since it is huge. It was hard to hear but it was a lively atmosphere."", 'Great place for a large group to dine and share food. The portion here is huge as it’s family style and worth the price. We ordered the crispy calamari, chicken marsala, linguine with white clam sauce, porterhouse contadina style, and two bottles of red wine. My favorite was the pasta! It was plenty for 6 people and even had leftovers to take home. We barely touched the bread knowing that we’ll get full from it. The service was great and the staff is amazing at upselling (so subtle and got us at times). They even sang happy birthday to my coworker and brought a free dessert.', ""I love the family style food, it's so easy to share different items with friends and family. It looks somewhat like a traditional Italian restaurant and it was packed to the brim, lots of tourists due to the location. The service was good, it can be a bit erratic when they get super busy but they are doing their best. We ordered several different items and they were all delicious with generous portions. We also ordered the Titanic dessert and it was a massive pile of ice cream, brownie, strawberries, and whipped cream. It definitely hit the spot."", ""We chose the wrong food option, it looked great, but the flavor wasn't my cup of tea. The food is family style and has giant portions. The salad was great and the free bread was ok. The water we got was expensive, didn't know it cost money till we got the bill. The waitress didn't come over that often and we had to ask for more water. If we got the right food option and the water didn't cost money, it would probably be a five star."", ""We all loved the place. It was Sunday morning, so good thing that we made a reservation as it was totally packed. Our table for 6 was ready within 5 minutes or less, however our server took like 15 minutes to come by and get our order. We loved the calamari and the artichokes, got the special with 4 different pastas and the veal. All to share. Everything was delicious. We will definitely come back on our next visit to NYC. If it's your first time, beware of the amount of food on each plate. We were 6 and couldn't finish it all.""]"
Boucherie Union Square,4.7,3208,"['This restaurant is in the top 3 restaurants I’ve ever been to! Our steaks were perfectly cooked and the service and atmosphere is remarkable. We got oysters and the watermelon salad for starters and everything was fresh and the sauces for the oysters were delicious especially the malt vinegar based sauce. I recommend the steak frites! For drinks get an espresso martini.', 'Our meal was extremely delicious, beautiful , and the service was amazing!!! The hostess was so nice, Jose at the bar was so professional, and our server Oscar was such a fun person we will definitely be back FOR SURE!  Great experience!!!!', 'A little chaotic but we did go closer to Christmas time so it’s justifiable. The food is soooo delicious. The steak was perfectly cooked. The desserts are to die for. The seafood tower was so refreshing and the staff were incredibly friendly!!', 'Grand Boucherie is more than just a restaurant—it’s a culinary journey that transports you straight to the heart of France. Best French onion soup in town. Their ambiance, service, and, most importantly, exceptional food is top notch. Highly recommend!', 'My boyfriend and I went here for his birthday on a Friday evening. Our experience was wonderful from the service to the food I would give it a 10/10. We have visited another location and we would return to both! Our waiter Oscar was exceptional as well making our experience as enjoyable as possible. We hope to return!']"
Upland,4.5,2153,"['Got the seared salmon and it had a great crispy skin with nice flaky flesh. The succotash was a lot more brothy than I expected but it was a pleasant accompaniment to the salmon and acted like a sauce. Satisfying and not too heavy for lunch.\n\nThe vibe of the place was very cozy. Gets lots of sunlight and is very roomy. The space allowed for conversation without too much background noise.', 'Great vibe place.  Service prompt and courteous.  Food quality is solid/good, but I can not say “out of this world.”  I would go back for a great time, drinks and atmosphere brought together with solid food.', 'The Hospitality was on point Rachel was our server and she was so nice to me and my friend I felt the atmosphere was nice the food was good despite me not liking the duck but I will definitely come back because it was spot on service and I will definitely recommend to my friends and if you have never been a must. And we love the setup of the restaurant the bar like close by the entrance of the restaurant. we ordered the duck wings and the skirt steak and the salmon everything was to my liking but just the duck to me was missing something but overall great experience great energy and a must to come back to thanks for the food Upland.The Hostess was nice also she was very welcoming I forgot to get her name but she had glasses but very nice.', ""Upland is always a favorite when I'm in NYC. The open, spacious, and bright area is welcoming, with good-sized tables that make dining comfortable. The service is consistently top-notch. I once dined alone while traveling for work, and they kindly offered me a free ice cream with my meal, which was a lovely gesture. The portions are generous (as you’d expect in America), so there's no need to over-order, and the quality is good."", ""Celebrated a birthday here. The food and atmosphere were great, but the service was above and beyond. Considering the food quality and service, it was definitely worth the price to us. From the pizza to salmon to short ribs nothing fell short.\n\nWe had a guest who is sensitive to some seasonings and they accommodated in a very nice way for her in a way some other restaurants of this caliber wouldn't.\n\nI would happily return again in the future""]"
Manhatta,4.7,2409,"['Food 9/10\nWent for a birthday dinner. The hamburger was surprisingly good, which we ordered at night even though it wasn’t on the dining area menu. The team was nice enough to allow us to put in three orders, in addition to the three course meal we put down. I was so stuffed at the end. The red wine was very smooth. All three courses were very solid, the duck was my least favorite part, as I felt like it could’ve been more tender / flavorful. Their desserts were very delicious, so delicious that I forgot to take a photo. But the star of the show was actually the hamburger, which thoroughly shocked me. I usually never eat hamburgers, so I guess this was a very pleasant surprise\n\nAtmosphere 10/10\nGorgeous skyscraper view of the city. It was beautiful to be seated facing north by the window, watching the sun set as we enjoyed our meal. Very spacious and sleek modern design.\n\nService 10/10\nAmazing service and hospitality.

From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, we were mesmerized by the jaw-dropping views—an incredible backdrop of the city skyline that adds a whole new level to the dining experience. The ambiance is refined and sophisticated, yet welcoming, making it the perfect spot for an unforgettable evening.\n\nOur waitress was phenomenal—lively, personable, and incredibly knowledgeable. She guided us through the menu with such passion, offering spot-on recommendations and ensuring we were well taken care of throughout the night. Her attention to detail and warm demeanor made the experience feel truly special.\n\nThe food was just as impressive as the view. Every dish was beautifully presented, bursting with flavor, and crafted with meticulous care. From the exquisite starters to the perfectly cooked entrees, each bite was an experience in itself. The cocktails and wine pairings were also on point, adding another layer of enjoyment to the meal.\n\nManhatta is more than just a restaurant—it’s a destination that offers exceptional food, stellar service, and *those* breathtaking views. Whether you’re celebrating a special occasion or simply want to experience the best of what NYC has to offer, Manhatta is a must-visit. Highly recommended!', 'We went last Saturday. I didn’t calculate time appropriately and was very late to my reservation, and the Manhatta team was super accommodating. Service was really good.\n\nI had the espresso martini and it was outstanding. I’ve ordered this same cocktail in many dining places and this one is my favorite so far. I ordered the 4-course tasting menu. I would it say it was good.\n\nThe view is unmatched. And we were lucky that that same night they were doing fireworks in Brooklyn which we could see at dessert time.', ""We wanted to try this exclusive dining experience via Capital one and were fortunate to have a window seat to celebrate our anniversary. The service was exceptional of course, with a breathtaking view, and most importantly, the food was exquisite! Every course was delightful, and this may be one of the few restaurants where we relished every dish. Nothing was overcooked; each ingredient was beautifully enhanced in flavor through creative and unique pairings. I opted for four courses, but we were completely stuffed by the second course to third course. Personally I'm a very picky New Yorker, especially with desserts, but Manhatta did not fail to amaze me. If you're seeking a beautiful and romantic restaurant with superb service and stunning views for an evening celebration, Manhatta is a must-visit!""]"
Per Se,4.5,1777,"['We have been to a few two and three star restaurants that did not live up to our expectations, but Per Se did. The food and service exceeded our expectations. When we first were seated at our table overlooking Columbus Circle, the hostess pointed to a small stool and said, ""This is a rest for your purse."" This small touch tells you about the attention level in the restaurant. Each course was perfectly timed and bursting with flavors. The sizes were perfect. By the end of the dinner we were full but not stuffed. And then came six or seven tiny desserts. At the end we got a bag with tasty morsels as mementos, as well as a menu of what we had signed by the chef. It was a memorable dinner.', ""This was an excellent experience. The service staff was phenomenal. They were very professional and friendly. They helped guide us through the menu and ensured our dietary restrictions were not a concern at all.  The main dining room and 9 course tasting menu comes  with a hefty price tag but it is worth it. The food is excellent and you will certainly leave full but not stuffed. This was one of the best meals we have had to date. Walking through a mall to get to a 3 Michelin Star restaurant is off putting but the view once you get there helps you forget all about that. I'm very happy we had the opportunity to eat in the main dining room and next time I am in New York I will do my best to get a reservation there again. Definitely add it to your must eat list when visiting NYC!"", 'When you book at a Michelin 3 Star restaurant expectations are pretty high. Especially when you fly in special to New York for your wife’s milestone birthday.\n\nCould it be that good?\n\nThe short answer is yes.\n\nAmazing view. I couldn’t believe our table overlooking Central Park.\n\nWait staff. Totally matched our vibe. Attentive, funny and the right mix of leave me alone with a hint of answering questions and lightheartedness. Shoutout to Eric!!!\n\nThe food. It’s all about the food, right? Upon the first bites in your mouth you wonder what you’ve been chewing your whole life. It certainly wasn’t this. I have the palette of a kindergartner and even I was blown away from the flavors, textures and sensations.\n\nTo top it off a few special extras for my wife’s birthday. Worth the special trip.  Couldn’t imagine having done anything else.', ""It's spectacular, it lived up to it's reputation. It's a seven course tasting menu, although if you count the number of desserts it's more like 11. We both had the wagyu supplement which we would highly recommend.\n\nWe have done a number of Michelin three starred restaurants, some deliver and some disappoint. In New York Per Se and Le Bernadin are both extraordinary. We were really underwhelmed by Jean George."", 'This place is so hard to review. Obviously the cooking is at a world-class standard, but aside from a couple of dishes like the classic oyster and pearls and the quail. Nothing really blows you away. The eight or nine different desserts is a nice touch at the end and there’s some real crackers in there the thing that’s most surprising about this place. Is that the atmosphere the decor feels like a Hilton lobby. Which when you’re paying $400 a plate feels very underwhelming, I’ve definitely had better. Michelin star Dan experiences and I would not say this is a must do.']"

I also recommend the ribs as they were finger licking good. My table had the peach salad, gumbo, and jambalaya. Everything was good.', ""Rare for me to give 5 stars across the board,  u tend to reserve that for the places I appreciate most in any particular trip.  We've ate at some great couples well in New York but this place is a hidden JEM!  A bit of the south tucked into a beautiful looking corner spot with outside seating.   The gumbo and jambalaya were both wonderful.   The drinks were great and the price is reasonable."", 'This is a fantastic restaurant! The food is excellently seasoned and the best I have ever tasted!

The drinks were also tasty and they had a great selection of cocktails. It’s a cozy spot and service was good. Can’t complain!', 'Today was my second time here. First time I came for dinner almost a year ago and today I did brunch. To me, brunch is the star of the show. The banana foster french toast was amazing! My friend also really enjoyed their fried chicken and waffles. I had a bite and it was really tasty. I have always loved their cocktails and it was good as I remembered. The only thing that was mid was the dirty rice. It just needed some salt. Otherwise, the seasoning was good. Im excited to come back and try some more things']"

Next time ask the customer because I’ll rather have a warm white bread.', 'Got super lucky and got the private room for a table for four!

A bit pricey ($120/person) but worth it.', 'My friends and I had dinner at Via Carota for the first time three weeks ago. It was one of the most special dinners I’ve ever experienced.  The kitchen staff perfectly executed each dish, as every bite was divine.  From the mouthwatering arancini, to the famed insalata verde, and to the show stopping Meyer lemon risotto- everything was truly unbeatable, unforgettable, and untouchable. We also ordered the melt-in-your mouth and perfectly seasoned rib eye, grilled artichokes, and cacio e pepe.

Boucherie West Village,4.7,4962,"['To be honest, we couldn’t get into the brunch spot we initially wanted so we came here. Milli was our server & was so adorable! She turned our spirits around and the food was incredible. Highly recommend this spot and her.', 'Five-Star Review:\n\nI recently dined at this charming French restaurant and was absolutely blown away by the food, especially the French onion soup and the lamb rack. The French onion soup was perfection—rich, deeply flavorful broth with just the right amount of sweetness from the caramelized onions. The cheese was beautifully melted, with a crust that made every spoonful indulgent and comforting.\n\nThe lamb rack was equally exceptional. Cooked to a perfect medium-rare, the meat was tender, juicy, and bursting with flavor. The herbs and seasoning complemented the natural richness of the lamb without overpowering it. The presentation was elegant, and the portion was generous.\n\nFrom start to finish, the meal was flawless, and the warm, inviting atmosphere made it even more enjoyable. I highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for an authentic and memorable French dining experience!', 'The restaurant has very nice atmosphere and the service is very good. After reading all 5 star reviews, I had high expectations for the food. In my opinion, food is the most important thing. Although all the items we ordered tastes good, but they all lack that “Wow” factor. I would probably give 5 stars for another restaurant, but for the price and setting for Boucherie at West Village, it does not justify that rating for the food alone.', 'Boucherie is undoubtedly one of my all-time favorite dining spots in all of Manhattan. Every visit feels like a special occasion, thanks to the consistently exceptional service and culinary offerings.\n\nThe menu is a delightful homage to classic French cuisine, and I’ve found myself drawn to several standout dishes. The steak tartare is expertly seasoned, with a perfect balance of flavors and textures that always leaves me craving more. The scallops are beautifully seared, tender, and served with a sauce that complements them flawlessly. The octopus is another highlight—grilled to perfection and bursting with flavor, it’s a must-try for seafood lovers.\n\nFor heartier fare, the beef bourguignon is a rich, comforting dish that embodies the essence of French cooking, while the ribeye steak is simply divine—juicy, flavorful, and cooked exactly to order. Each dish showcases the kitchen’s attention to detail and commitment to quality.\n\nThe beverage selection is equally impressive, featuring an excellent array of French wines that pair wonderfully with the menu. Whether you’re a wine connoisseur or just looking to explore, there’s something for everyone. Additionally, Boucherie offers a fantastic selection of absinthe and creative cocktails that elevate the dining experience.\n\nOur server, Lola, deserves a special mention. She was incredibly attentive and knowledgeable, providing excellent recommendations and making sure our experience was flawless. Her warm demeanor added to the inviting atmosphere of the restaurant.\n\nOverall, I can’t recommend Boucherie highly enough. Whether you’re celebrating a special occasion or simply enjoying a night out, this restaurant delivers an unforgettable experience that captures the spirit of French dining. It’s a true gem in Manhattan that I’ll keep returning to.', ""Milli was fantastic, we had the best girls brunch. The food was great, we enjoyed the Wagu burger and fries.

Gabriel Kreuther,4.6,1147,"[""I've been to many 3-star, 2-star and 1-star Michelin restaurants, so using this context to rate Gabriel Kreuther, which has 2 Michelin stars.  While we had a good meal, it was not at the 2 Michelin star level ... more like 1 ... at best.  We had the Chef's Tasting Menu, which consisted of 7 courses for $265, which is a fairly reasonable price.  Most of our courses were pretty good and creative, though the fluke was overcooked and was too dry,  the ravioli were so-so and the sturgeon tart was too flaky and dry.  The dishes were nicely presented, but not at the 2 Michelin star level.  But the biggest issue was service, which was not even at the 1-star level.  Our server was mostly nowhere to be found and was not at all attentive.  He spoke in a way that was hard to understand.  Our table was not cleaned timely between courses and once they brought another course with the empty dishes from the prior one still sitting on our table.  Not the end of the world, of course, but should never happen at a 2 Michelin star restaurant where I am paying over $1000 for a dinner for 2 people).  The delay between courses was too long at times.  Some courses came pretty quickly and others had a much longer delay.  Water was not always added when we ran out, etc.  Really disappointing service.  Overall, not a bad meal, but not at the 2 Michelin star level."", 'My guest and I had a great experience at this restaurant. The staff were all especially attentive and friendly, and answered all of our questions. The alcoholic as well as nonalcoholic drinks were really great. The only person that was a little bit snobbish/odd vibes was the woman who kept pushing her wines, everything else was great. The food was good, not great but good enough and satisfying.

Tao is definitely a must-visit for anyone looking for delicious Asian cuisine in the city!', ""I recently celebrated my birthday at Tao, and it was an unforgettable experience! The ambiance was absolutely stunning, with its chic decor and calming vibe, creating the perfect setting for a special occasion. The menu was filled with a wide variety of delicious dishes, each one more flavorful than the last. From start to finish, the food was exceptional, and the staff was attentive and made the evening feel extra special. If you're looking for a place to celebrate or just enjoy a great meal in a beautiful setting, Tao is definitely worth visiting!"", 'The vibe in this place is amazing! The lighting is very minimal, which makes the meal so pleasant. They also used wieghted glasses, also nice. The fish was so fresh, and the tuna just melted in your mouth. We sat in a booth, and it was so comfortable, with soft velvet. The staff was very nice, and multiple people came to check on us throughout our meal. You should also get a reservation, that way you can actually get a table. This is a very unique experience in NYC. Go try it out for yourself.']"
Carbone New York,4.3,2072,"[""One of the best Italian in NYC but it's a bit pricey. Worth it to try on special occasions. Spicey rigatoni was def delicious but not worth it's high price tag.

From the quaint but vibrant atmosphere, impeccable service and absolutely delicious food.\nOur server Antonio was on point. Great suggestions, speedy service with a friendly touch.\nThe burrata with caviar was my favourite dish with its complex and tantalizing flavours.\nThe Veal parmigiana was also incredible with a tasteful presentation.\nThe warm mozzarella (not on the menu) was also a special treat.\nI’d highly recommend the Caesar salad and the spicy rigatoni as well.\nCarbone is a special experience with impeccable service and fantastic food.\nI highly recommend it.', 'It’s kind of like seeing behind the curtain in the Wizard of Oz. I have to give credit where credit is due. My first experience in this physical space was when it was formerly Rocco’s years ago. Since then, I have longed to get behind the heavy velvet curtains. As, it happens, it’s not what you know it’s who you know. I was able to get a reservation thru a friend of a friend. Quite frankly, I was somewhat overwhelmed when we were seated in the amazing dining room that adjoins the bar in the back. Starstruck is probably the best description of what it felt like. We ordered four courses, rounds of cocktails, and dessert. One of the highlights of the evening was the staff singing happy birthday to my special guest. Each dish is literally a taste bud orgasm. No expense is spared in selecting the best of the best ingredients and quite frankly it’s readily apparent that a ninja or ninjas are working back in the kitchen. The only reason that I am giving four stars and not five is that it so happens this was the only time  in my adult life that, I have been encouraged to box up my dessert to free up the table. We did not order a bottle of wine, we did spend several hundred dollars including the gratuity. After the second round of cocktails was cleared from the table, I was mildly disappointed that reinforcements were not eagerly offered. I have been a guest in many of this groups restaurants and while each is unique like a snowflake, I never had this type of experience.  I will not let this keep me from coming back or tarnishing my impression of otherwise flawless evening. I hope you have a friend of a friend and get treated to one of life’s many pleasures, and evening at Carbone. God Bless Blue & Gold! God Bless America! Remember Everyone Deployed Everyday!', 'I had a very pleasant experience for it being my first time!\n\nThe entire staff was exceptional hospitable. I was promptly seated by the kind hosts and our waiter Mark M was amazing! He assured us that our food was prepared accordingly to my fiancés food allergy, was extremely nice, patient and checked in on us frequently to make sure we were enjoying our meals. He provided an exceptional service that I don’t see too often.\n\nThe food was delicious! The Caesar salad was fresh and one of the best I ever had. Although every plate was delicious, I was a little disappointed in how frugal they were with the ragu sauce for the tortellini. It was a little runny, and did not have a lot of meat.\n\nOther than that, I think Carbone is definitely worth the experience, and I’m very pleased!', 'The impossible reservation! Until I just… randomly got a table on a Wednesday. I heard so much about this place. The food. The history. The ambience. The front of house staff were wonderful, this feels like a 5 star restaurant. We sat and were greeted by our server, who seemed polite. Until we took a little too much time deciding what to eat. There was certainly a feel of being rushed, but despite this, our food arrived and it didn’t disappoint! We had a selection of their pastas and then ordered any recommended deserts. Other than the service during the meal,\nIt was overall an enjoyable time. I wished there were 1/2 stars as I’d probably give it 3.5. Don’t forget the Italian candies at the exit…']"

We arrived a little before our 12pm booking and the dining room had seated 2 tables (a couple and a party of 3). Immediately you notice the cool air, high ceilings, low lighting and large medallion ""necklaces"" worn by the sommeliers. (at least 3 spotted) We chose the smaller tasting menu. The wine pairing recommendations were great. The bread basket presentation and choices were delightful. The raw and lightly cooked dishes were interesting and satisfying. The service staff balanced being there when you wanted something and being inconspicuous (near walls and doorways) when not in customer service mode. I ended up buying the Seafood Simple book after tasting the menu here.  Thank you for a wonderful dining experience and for making my birthday special.', 'La Bernadin is easily the greatest culinary disappointment in the city given its 3 star rating. The ambience, stuffy and drab. While the service is attentive, the food is absolutely lacking and overpriced. It’s baffling to me this continues to retain 3 stars. The dishes are common fair that you’re familiar with, nothing unique or creative here: shrimp, salmon, halibut, snapper, lobster, and so on. For $325 the tasting brings you 8 courses, 2 of which are dessert bites. The fish, dainty and unremarkable leaves you wishing you had just stopped for a slice or spent your money at literally any other venture in the city. $1300 for a group of 3 with one wine pairing, our table agreed the morsels were middling at best, the 1 bite of salmon and caviar is easily the star of the show. The dessert, it’s hard to go wrong with sorbet and chocolate so enjoy your one bite of each. And to end the journey a chefs compliment of dessert containing nuts for my nut allergic friend, good thing he was paying attention otherwise we would have had a medical emergency on our hands. Was anything comped for risking his life? No, a simple “oops sorry” was provided. It’s truly amazing to me this institution, likely a shell of its former self, where the faux luxury is as thin as the foam on your appetizer, continues to be regarded with any esteem whatsoever.', ""You can only imagine how thrilled we were as seafood lovers to visit a 3 Michelin-starred restaurant specializing in seafood, and it exceeded all expectations. We chose the chef's tasting menu, and it was truly out of this world. Each dish was unique, yet all harmonized beautifully, leading to an unforgettable experience. The dessert was absolutely divine.\n\nHowever, I did subtract one star in the ambience category as it felt quite packed and was a bit noisy, though I acknowledge this is very subjective."", 'We went to Le Bernardin about two months ago. The restaurant itself is very elegant and it is amazing for seafood lovers. We had the chefs tasting menu as well as the vegetarian tasting menu. All of the food was great but the langoustine and the chocolate tart was exceptional. At Le Bernardin they gave huge importance to all of the sauces. The sauces made the dish even more fabulous. We also got a special kitchen tour where we got to see how all the delicious food was being made. It was overall a great experience.']"

As I waited for my friends to arrive, the waiter was attentive and asked if I wanted to be served as she dropped off the menus. I got my drink & water before they arrived several minutes later. Water glasses were quickly filled and the waiter came by again to take drink and food orders. We started with the oysters, unfortunately, they were a bit small and not so tasty -  was not a fan of the sauces provided. I would probably try this again as it’s not really the season for oysters right now. The shrimp wantons was a table favorite, as was the calamari. The flatbread was small and just Ok. We ordered a second round of food as it was our dinner. The Manchego mac and cheese was outstanding! It was probably the best Mac n cheese I’ve had at a restaurant with a healthy amount of cheese and perfectly prepared with a toasted top. The 3 of us were almost full but we managed to finish the very good truffle fries. I probably wouldn’t order the roasted peppers next time, even though they were prepared excellently. All the food arrived piping hot, which should be easy to do but most places don’t do this. The place was buzzy with people drinking but there was still room if you wanted to drink, arrive early for a table. Fantastic happy hour! Oct 2024', ""This place is great and very low key. The service was perfect, and the food was also great. It's not pretentious and roomier than most other restaurants in the area. The mixed drinks were superb.

It was served with an amazing sauce, once we finished we were able to use the bread to dip in the sauce. For our entrees I had the filet de boeuf which was a piece of bone marrow with beef which was cooked perfectly. It was served with the creamiest of mashed potatoes. What an amazing dish. My girlfriend ordered the rabbit and she loved it. It was prepared 3 different ways and she loved it. The ambiance was amazing, a really nice restaurant.  I highly recommend this place but make sure you make a reservation.', 'Le Coucou is an absolute gem in NYC! From the moment I walked in, I knew I was in for a special experience.

It was HUGE and far too much for two people but a great value at $30.\n\nNice and attentive staff. Solid wine list.\n\nWorth a visit!', 'We were there with a few friends. The place is cozy (piccolo is not just the name). I think the smallest bathroom I have been to in NYC. The decoration is very nice. It has a singular way to display seafood in ice.\n\nThe food was ok but not great. We all felt that way. I shared the green tagliatelle and the lasagna. I would not recommend any. The desserts were really good and quite a good selection. The cream brulee was delicious.\n\nThey do this ""happy birthday"" moment, that I was not expecting at an Italian restaurant. We had 3 birthday songs just that night.']"
Jack's Wife Freda,4.4,3636,"[""If you are visiting New York and you're in Soho searching for an exceptional brunch experience, look no further than Jack's Wife Freda.

Beware of the line so it’s always better to order beforehand if you want to find a spot inside!', ""From all the various fun cities I've visited in the US, this is probably the closest to a French patio dining vibe! The food was a combination of Mediterranean/Middle Eastern cuisine! We were fortunate as the weather was very mild in June, which made for very pleasant outdoor dining! They have other locations of this chain, but we simply walked by the other spot and went back to this spot multiple times! The service was very friendly and prompt, and each dish tasted fresh and delicious!\n\nI would highly recommend this spot for a drink, meal, or just a nice glass of wine to relax and enjoy NY!"", 'After an amazing time at The Color Factory, we headed to Jack’s Wife Freda for lunch, and it was the perfect choice! My wife ordered the burger with fries, while I went for the steak, and we both absolutely loved our meals. The burger was juicy and flavorful, with perfectly crispy fries on the side—my wife couldn’t stop raving about it! Meanwhile, the steak was cooked to perfection, tender and full of flavor, making it a real standout.\n\nWe paired our meals with a glass of wine, which added a lovely touch to our lunch. The wine selection was great, and the staff’s recommendation was spot-on, enhancing the flavors of our dishes.

They were all incredible but the zucchini was stunning!\n\nFor mains we had the Steak Roll and the Schnitzel, both were amazing and the steak was so tender. Only slight issues was our server seem really busy as she had so many tables.\n\nWould come back again, so worth a visit!']"

We got a table in the garden/open area in the back.\nWe came here for a birthday lunch and left very happy with the food and the service. We Ordered vegetarian options from the menu and everything was delicious. The fried mushrooms were just wow and so was the bread in the appetizer, the vegetarian pasta and vegan pizza. The service was impeccable, friendly and informative. The ambience was upscale yet very inviting and chill.\nAll in all we left quite satisfied and would like to return again. A little off the main streets but worth the visit.', 'Great food - nice calm and quiet little restaurant near Pier 40!\nPerfect for a little patio lunch or you can sit inside in their cute little seating area!\nRavioli was delicious\nSpicy sausage pizza was a hit!', 'I love the restaurant for their breakfast. For the healthier options, they had mixed berry salad and gluten-free avocado toast. The food tasted so fresh and delicious. The service was so great too. I recommend this place to everyone.', 'The atmosphere is open and airy and reflects the energy of the entire establishment. Food was great and service even better! If you go, definitely ask for Dian, he’s very personable and attentive with a killer personality.', 'A really lovely restaurant! Everything was fresh and delicious.

Craft,4.5,1135,"['Craft was a lovely experience throughout from the hostess saying hello to our server. The food was incredible, loved the different varieties of food and flavours. The restaurant is beautiful and provides lovely atmosphere throughout. We received compliments of the house soups to clean our palette, followed by great pairing of drinks, my friend and I shared a light and refreshing beet salad, and had our individual dishes of pasta, followed by a lovely dessert. Great place to connect with a good friend. Highly recommend.', 'As a tourist, this restaurant was recommended by a local, and it did not disappoint!  Each staff member was extremely polite and attentive. The food was delicious and the portions were large (my friend and I split a salad, entree, and side and still had left over). Would recommend to anyone visiting the city', 'Craft has an extensive and expensive selection of side dishes, including some very pricey mushrooms. The fingerling potatoes were nice and crispy. The papardelle with braised lamb was tasty. Everything was delicious but nothing that you’re still thinking about the next day. Great menu for sharing to try a little of many things.', 'Great vibes. Loved the atmosphere and service. Some of the dishes were great. Loved the duck. Also love the idea of locally sourcing ingredients directly from farms. The scallop tasted a bit off. Everything else was great.', 'Overall a wonderful date night. Great staff, drinks and vibe. Some of the food was great - but much of it tasted just OK, and the duck I was served was a big let down. The waiter mentioned this was a family style restaurant - and that the gist of ""Craft"" is putting together your own smorgasbord of items to mix and match as you eat. I can see how this would be a much better dining experience food wise with a group. When you can only order a handful of items, stakes are high if something doesn\'t hit.\n\nHere\'s a run down on our order, and as always, you might just love something that I was not into and vice versa.\n\nArugula Salad - unexpected winner here. the fresh greens, dressing and pine nuts all come together to make a surprisingly excellent salad. Almost skipped this, kudos to the wife on insisting.\n\nAligot - this is basically an incredibly cheesy mashed potato, possibly the best I\'ve ever had. If you like cheese and potato\'s this is a must. It also made the duck much more palatable.\n\nHen of the woods - Lots of mentions of this in other reviews. The way they prepare it definitely lets the mushroom shine for itself. Tasted fresh, good flavor, but not mind blowing or anything.\n\nMilk Braised Lamb Pappardelle - the lamb portions were great, extremely tender and flavorful. But the lamb and relatively plain pasta wasn\'t really enough to wow me. In this case, I might just be too much of a red sauce glutton to appreciate it.\n\nScallops - the scallops were very well done, perfect I\'d say. They do provide more of the sauce on the side if you wanted to have some on every bite, but they were flavorful enough as initially presented.\n\nDuck - This one was unfortunately the saddest part of the meal. It was a large portion, but the breast has no crispy skin on it at all. It also looked much different than some of other photos of duck others have posted. I unfortunately just wasn\'t into the way the duck breast was prepped this time around. The confit was the better half of the dish, but honestly, this was the dish I was most excited for, and yet it created the greatest regret. If you do order this, find a photo of it in the reviews that you like and ask if that\'s what it\'ll look like. Feel like I got catfished.\n\nChocolate Soufflé - the ice cream/gelato on the side was excellent and its a very good soufflé. I was pretty full at this point and wish I had room to try the crème brulee cheesecake.\n\nThey also provided a final little treat, and an yet another treat on our way out. A nice ""just one more thing"" touch!\n\nAgain, the drinks were all very good. Our waiter was very informative and friendly. Can\'t say I was wowed food wise - although a couple of dishes were fantastic.\n\nOverall, if I were to visit again, it would be with a larger group to try more things. Still, had a wonderful time.']"

The lovely hostess made it magical for our kids upon entry, we were treated with the table in the window, the food was fresh and tasty and the kids loved it!  There is not a kids menu but they will do kids pasta, simple burger, steak, chicken, etc. One of our kids - the pickiest eater -  ordered a butter pasta and said it was the best they ever had. We all tried it and agreed, had to order another!\nThere is a pretty limited wine selection but all were very good.  Beer selection could be improved.

I came here for my mother's 40th birthday and I really want to thank the staff for making it memorable. A complimentary birthday cake was given to us and the staff sang her happy birthday.

I want to thank the manager Basdeo for making our night so special."", 'Food is ok, not spectacular as I had expected from previous reviews. The tomato was very good, but the rest was not very tasty.

The on the house salad, beets and pickles were pretty good, specially the beets tasted great. On the main courses we selected the Disco fries, their original burger and butterfly shrimp fries with tarter sauce. Their disco fries were awesome, the melted cheese n mushroom gravy wasn’t too overpowering rather made the fries very delicious. Their shrimps were of really good sizes and they were fried with batter perfectly. The burger also looked really good and delicious.', ""All I really need to enjoy my day is a cold blond beer and a mouthwatering hotdog! Seriously, the food here is absolutely amazing—every bite is a delight.

It really adds to the overall experience! I’m already looking forward to my next visit to this fantastic spot on my next trip to Manhattan. It’s definitely a place I can't wait to return to!"", 'This location is right by the theaters and a little smaller and simpler than the 49th street location, which has a bigger and more Times Square vibe. However it is the same excellent, large serving size food (the steak burger was large and delicious), friendly staff, and expensive (but iconic) cheesecake. Even when the line is out the door into the street, you will probably be seated in less than 20 minutes, and often you can grab seats at the bar. Food is always brought out fast. The vibe is diner+ and very casual. Overall any Juniors location is something we hit during every NYC visit and always find it reliable and consistent.', 'I can arguably say this is my favorite cheesecake in the world! A New York visit won’t be complete without having a Strawberry cheesecake…it’s just the best! Other favorites are chocolate mousse cake & red velvet layer cake!\nP.S.\nMy plate says it all! 😋😂😋', 'Junior’s serves up great food with large portions, making it a satisfying stop for anyone looking for a hearty meal. The menu prices are on the higher side, but the quality of the food makes it worth considering. Service is excellent—friendly and attentive staff who really enhance the experience.\n\nHowever, the seating arrangements left much to be desired. We were squeezed into a tiny table, and they had to physically move it just to let people in and out, which was a bit uncomfortable.\n\nOverall, it’s worth the trip just to check it off the list and say you’ve been there, but the seating situation might make you think twice about going back.']"
Grand Banks,4.3,1726,"['Seated and waited for more than 15 minutes without getting any servers. Later our waitress apologized for not being acknowledged our table. Great views and atmosphere.

The lobster rolls and fries were also excellent, I loved the garlicky aoli for the fries.  The oysters were also delicious, very fresh.  It is more of a place for adults but older kids will enjoy it as well for the view.  A great place to get a drink on a date I am betting.']"

I will be returning to this place.', 'I’m not a fan of bagels or American breakfast, but my boyfriend enjoys them, so we decided to try this spot since it was close to our hotel and had good reviews. I didn’t order anything, but he got a bagel with salmon, cream cheese, and capers, along with a hot chocolate.\n\nThe place was packed, and the staff was very friendly, which we appreciated. However, for what he ordered, I felt the price was quite high. A bagel breakfast and hot chocolate cost $30 plus tip, which seemed a bit much.

More unique dishes were the roasted chickpea with vindaloo sauce and the lamb rolled in grape leaves and excellent pine nut spiced topping. Lastly, the deserts, take a breath and allow your mind to process how savory and sweet can be transformed into unique works of art and a new experience.', ""A wonderful spot that provides a fantastic Vegan tasting menu and an omnivore option  for those who are not of the same palate.\n\nThis is a review of the tasting menu for Omnivore $145 and iberico pork supplement for $18 (4/5)\n\nHonestly, the white asparagus ALONE could have made this place a 5/5 because those are some phenomenal veggies.

Exquisite Service for sure. (5/5)\n\nOther than that this is probably one of the best Vegetarian tasting menus that a person can get as Musket Room is making strides.\n\nA point taken down because the casual atmosphere brought some really loud guest that took away from appreciating the environment or food as a nice date spot. Some of the food also did not really hit like the halibut or potato cauliflower. Can't say I was the biggest fan of them. If you do get the garden (It is a rule that you MUST be punctual, it would be an EASY 5/5.

Overall that was really disappointing as they are $18 for two buns so one would expect each to be full of meat and not just a glob of fat and gristle. We had the tuna nachos as well and I think theyre missing an opportunity here by using the fried wonton chips. Just serve it with normal tortilla chips and it will be perfect… we had a pizza that was great and my mother in law loved her belgian waffle.

Food tastes better than it looks. We thought that lobster was on the small side but man, it was so rich in flavours - definitely try it.\n\nOysters were so fresh, my friend had ‘em all in a seating. The pannacotta with vinegar and honey was so interesting, didn’t look like much but every bite was infused with vanilla beans.\n\nHighly recommend!', 'Great food generally but with some exceptions. Of all the recs, Ricotta dumplings were underwhelming and disappointing. I am almost confused as to why it is named dumpling. The texture is too soft, crumbly, the cheese looks unappetizing because the separation looks like the cheese is curdling. The broth is nice but not enough to offset the strange choice to call this dish a dumpling. It’s more like watery crumbly cheese. Not creative or daring. Safe choice to rely on the flavor of cheese. As for the star choices, Endive and black fried rice were fantastic. Amazing mix of flavors, well balanced. I would not assume it’s a Michelin star restaurant based on the B+ quality of service but I get how the service staff try hard to take their food and drinks seriously hence the standout dishes. It just doesn’t have the elegance or sophistication to reach for more. I would go back for the two dishes but maybe sit at a bar so I don’t need to awkwardly smile at mediocrity of service and attention.', 'Great vibe, dimly lit and buzzing. Good for groups or date night. Endive salad and squid ink rice were phenomenal. You can skip the ricotta dumplings. Great drinks and gluten free options.', ""This was truly one of my favorite dining experiences I've had in my life.  The food was 'eyes rolling to the back of your head' deliciously surprising with every bite.  Our Server was so educated on both the beverage and food menu, was engaging and had a sophisticated wit.  We ended up befriending our table neighbors and engaging in culinary & foodie conversation and ended up toasting to her celebrating a fun win. If you're going to celebrate, treat yourself or just want the triple threat in Food, Beverage and Hospitality this is your new favorite place... I can't wait to visit again.""]"
Frevo,4.8,619,"['Best dinner I’ve ever had in NYC, a step up from Le Bernardin or Per Se - exceptionally creative, sophisticated, fascinating and delicious tasting menu.

Possibly only better dinner was at Persona in Stockholm and there were a lot of similarities.', 'Was an excellent experience all around. The food was so good!

Those were only a small number of the amazing dishes we had.\n\nThe music is so well balanced volume wise where it was present and could be clearly hear but didn’t overpower anything else from my wife’s voice to the sound of the chefs working.\n\nThe staff was very knowledgeable and friendly, and took the time to intentionally have conversation with you.\n\nFor the after dinner coffee, it was the only thing that didn’t feel to the same standard as everything else. It didn’t have a high level of complexity like everything else that we had. But it was still enjoyable.', ""Unbelievable tasting experience. Having tried quite a few one-or-two Michelin star tasting programs in NYC, Frevo is the best. Every one of the dishes in the course is most inventive, refreshingly delicious and awakening one's taste buds.

Sylvia's Restaurant,4.3,8010,"['I had to pay a visit to this Harlem’s institution! Sylvia’s has been an iconic landmark for more than 60 years now.\nI had the pleasure to go there for lunch with friends a few days ago and to indulge in a true Southern classic: fried chicken and waffles. The crispy, golden-brown chicken was perfectly seasoned, with just the right amount of crunch and juiciness in each bite. Paired with the fluffy, buttery waffle, it was a delightful balance of savory and sweet.\nThe chicken’s flavor stood out—comforting, with a touch of spice that complemented the rich syrup drizzled over the waffles. The combination is a simple yet satisfying dish that captures the essence of soul food. The warm, welcoming atmosphere at Sylvia’s adds to the overall experience, making it feel like you’re at a family gathering. You can find pics with all the most important people, politicians and celebrities from the past several decades on the walls.\nService is extremely good and efficient and ready to give you informations about the place at any time. We had to wait to be seated but the guy in charge of leading us to our table was so kind and accommodating!\nFor anyone seeking an authentic Harlem dining experience, Sylvia’s delivers on tradition and flavor. Whether you’re a local or a visitor, this spot is a must for anyone craving a taste of soul.', 'Harlem first timers, let me introduce you to Silvia’s. Chances are, you may have already heard of them because so many people have eaten there. Their brand of soul food deserves special recognition because the family behind the business adhere to traditional recipes and deliver that finger-licking goodness day in, day out.\n\nWe had a delightful dinner experience: sitting in the back corner of the outdoor dining area, looking across a lively turnout of dinner guests while enjoying our delicious Catfish Fingers, Cornbread, and colourful cocktails. The staff were friendly, and the food was good.\n\nFor mains, it was difficult for us to look past the classics: we had the BBQ Beef Short Ribs and Down Home Fried Chicken. Both worked well with our selection of side dishes. The Mac-n-Cheese and Collard Greens dampens the sauciness of the Beef Short Ribs. The Candied Yams and String Beans balances out the crunchiness of the Fried Chicken. Sylvia’s signature hot sauce was also a bit of fun to have on the side.\n\nBefore leaving, we made sure to walk around to check out the many photographs hanging around the restaurant. Sylvia’s is really a lot more than just a restaurant. It’s a museum. Overall, a must visit when in this neighbourhood.', 'The macaroni and cheese, fried chicken and waffle were great! Food came out fresh! The only negatives were that the black eyed peas were okay and the pork chops were extremely overcooked. Other than that, the atmosphere and service was great.', 'Longstanding soul food restaurant with accompanying atmosphere you go back in time. You’ll find locals and tourists dining here. Restaurant is a bit noisy but that’s part of the experience. Great for larger group dinners. Service is quick. Staff made suggestion where to put the stroller, which I appreciated. Although I am not an expert on soul food; it seems traditional and is tasty especially with Sylvia secret sauce. Only negative is the limited choice and poor quality of wine but that’s not where you come for here anyway.', ""I am a NY native and I can't remember if I've ever been to Sylvia's BUT I went today, and they definitely did not disappoint. It was a pretty long wait but it was so worth it. The corn bread the smothered chicken and waffle, all I needed was a blanket and a pillow and I would have been knocked out.

This brought the overall experience down a notch considering the amount we paid was not less than the folks who could enjoy indoors in scorching June heat.', 'Pros: Had a great meal at Junoon. The highlight was the duck tellicherry. Not something you commonly find on an Indian restaurant menu and it was cooked to perfection. The drinks were also top notch.

Overall a memorable experience,  great service and probably one of the best Indian meals you can get in the city.\n\nCons: I kinda knew this going in but for two people, with one round of drinks after tip was $300, which felt a little bit on the high end even for NYC.

A refined experience from top to bottom, 53 is a perfect destination for the special occasion.\n\nA menu that is filled with an array of smaller but shareable dishes, it is easy to try a variety of dishes. To get the full experience, I would recommend trying one to two dishes from each section of the menu. The rock shrimp and Xiao Long Bao were two standout offerings.\n\nIn addition to the incredible food, the dining room is really quite stunning. While the main floor is set off by a distinct bar and lounge aesthetic, the subterranean dining room has an elegant aesthetic. Dad gives you the feel of an upscale night in New York City.\n\nThough midtown struggles for quality restaurants, 53 is carrying the banner for a rejuvenated dining scene in the neighborhood.', 'Instantly up there with one of the best dining experiences of my life. From the vibe of the place to the hospitality of the staff. To the killer cocktails and absolutely gourmet cuisine, this place just shot up in my list of favorites in NYC, maybe the world.

The food, service and our comfort level were perfect. It’s always nice to get treated like family, enjoy really tasty food and dine in comfort.\nGrazie mille a tutti 💋', 'Tucked away in the bustling heart of NYC’s Financial District, Joseph’s Italian Restaurant offers a pre-fix dinner option within a setting that exudes comfort and a welcoming atmosphere. Its proximity to the lively Stone Street and the renowned Harry’s Steakhouse adds to its allure as a dining destination in FiDi. The interior ambiance strikes the right note for a pleasant dining experience, offering a respite from the urban rush.\n\nMy decision to dine at Joseph’s was influenced by the promise of a serene environment paired with the convenience of its location. However, while the setting met expectations, certain aspects of the service and culinary experience left room for improvement.\n\nThe service was adequate up until the conclusion of our meal, when the attentiveness of our server notably diminished. The prolonged wait to request our check, seemingly forgotten after our table was cleared, detracted from the overall dining experience. Furthermore, the presentation of my leftovers in a simple plastic ‘Thank You’ bag, placed unceremoniously on the table before dessert was even served, lacked the finesse one might expect from an establishment of Joseph’s caliber.\n\nCulinary-wise, the dishes were satisfactory, yet unremarkable. The steak, requested medium, leaned towards medium-rare, verging on rare at its core. Additionally, a specific request to substitute the mushroom sauce due to allergies resulted in a plain, sauceless steak, rather than an alternative concoction from the chef. This oversight was disappointing and contributed to the overall oddity of the meal.\n\nThe dessert course brought its own set of mixed feelings. While the tiramisu I received was enjoyable, the portion size compared to my friend’s—visibly about 20% larger—left me feeling somewhat overlooked. Whether my slice was unusually small or my friend’s was generously oversized, it introduced a sense of inconsistency that marred the end of our meal.\n\nThe value proposition of dining at Joseph’s Italian Restaurant is debatable. While the location is undoubtedly prime, nestled within the FiDi area and surrounded by ample dining alternatives, the culinary and service missteps suggest that there’s room for refinement.\n\nIn conclusion, Joseph’s Italian Restaurant earns a solid three stars from me. It stands as a nice spot in the Financial District with potential for greatness, yet the inconsistencies in service, culinary execution, and the dessert disparity suggest that there is yet some way to go in fully realizing its promise.', 'What a gem!  We had a meeting a few blocks away, found this on Google Maps, it looked interesting with Northern Italian cuisine. Early on a Wednesday evening—No reservation no problem. Great service from the staff, (many from Albania) wonderful atmosphere. Joseph’s is a gem. Food was excellent. Wine was great.

Despite its attractive appearance, every dish we ordered tasted horrible, lacking any real flavor or freshness. I expected much more given the hype surrounding this place. Unfortunately, I won't be returning, and I can't recommend it to others either. Save your time and money and go somewhere else."", 'I recently dined at NOMO Kitchen in NYC, and I must say that I found the experience to be underwhelming.

I would recommend considering other dining options and saving your money.', 'Lemon ricotta pancakes were good, latte with oat milk was a big disappointment', 'Came for a ladies’ brunch on a Saturday morning.

Osteria Carlina West Village,4.8,719,"['This was definitely the best Italian restaurant I’ve been to in the past year! Charming little spot with great service and amazing food.

No big deal.\n\nWe ordered a prosciutto sandwich and a burger (medium rare). Sandwich was good.\n\nWhen I cut into the burger there were chunks of chopped meat that fell out. The inside was still raw with white un rendered fat. They likely didn’t take the internal temp and the grill was too hot so only the outside got seared.\n\nI asked the server if they could pop it back on the grill to medium instead. They put the whole sandwich in the oven to warm it and sent it back to me, saying that the cook said I had ordered medium rare 🙂.\n\nEither I don’t know temperatures or they don’t… I think the pictures are clear (pictures are from after they tried to get it to temp).']"

For my third drink, I opted for the Cabin Spicy Margarita, which had just the right kick to it. To wrap up my evening, I couldn’t resist the Campfire Old Fashioned—a delightful twist on a classic that left a lasting impression.\n\nWhen it came to food, we decided to go for shareable plates, and I was pleasantly surprised by the portion sizes.

We were a group of 5 ladies and were seated in a very tight space that\'s probably best for 4 people. The food is good, but nothing outstanding. My biggest complaint though is when restaurants state they have maple syrup on the menu, and it\'s basically corn syrup. I\'d rather they say ""pancake syrup"" or something, as it\'s misleading. This Canadian knows real maple syrup 😉\n\nOverall a good experience and a fun place to come with friends.

Just make this your first stop... because ""holy s***"" is the primary phrase that comes to mind as I try to describe this place to you.\n\nThe decor in the place is very rustic and comfortable (we are from Canada and I grew up on a farm, so I slid right into my comfort zone under the antler chandelier). It started out like any dining experience - I ordered an Amaretto Sour out of habit; until the waitress made a suggestion off their specialty cocktail list she thought I would really enjoy. I\'m just going to tell you - if they make an alternate suggestion to your order, you just go ahead and listen to them. I wish I could remember the name or what was in it because it was easily the best drink I had our entire trip to NYC. The food that came later was absolutely top notch as well, if the budget would have allowed I think I\'d have asked for about 6 plates of each dish we shared at our table!\n\nAnother nice touch, someone who gave us the vibe of being the owner came around occasionally to make sure we were enjoying our meals as well as engage in friendly conversation.

In fact you have great ingredients, however your chef can’t use them properly. It is incredibly weird for me, that you cannot make a simple pasta dish. I ordered a squid ink linguine and I was so disappointed. Pasta itself was slightly overcooked , which is already a big no, but the worst was a lack of salt and a huge amount of chilli. I could taste cuttlefish and basil, but it should have had a hint of garlic, plus in this kind of restaurant you shouldn’t be adding salt yourself. Prices are expensive so food should always be on point. Unfortunately a nice ambience and a decent service isn’t enough for me if you pay that much money.', ""I had the absolute pleasure of dining at Altro Paradiso, and it was truly one of the most unforgettable culinary experiences of my life!

Each plate is meant to be shared, so I recommend ordering different items from the menu. The pasta was so fresh and delicious. Bestia was crowded that night, and seating us took a little longer. Still, as a surprise apology, the chef sent a complimentary pizza to our table, which we appreciated and respected. The energy is lively and loud, perfect for meeting with friends for drinks and a great meal. We loved it!', ""Bestia, located in the Arts District of Los Angeles, is a culinary gem that continues to live up to its reputation as one of the city's top dining destinations. From the moment we arrived, the experience was exceptional, starting with the warm and efficient service provided by the hostess. Despite not having a reservation, we were seated within five minutes—a rare stroke of luck given how bustling the restaurant was. It’s a testament to Bestia’s popularity, and I would definitely recommend making a reservation to avoid the wait.\n\nAntipasti: A Perfect Start\nWe began our meal with a selection of antipasti, and I must say, Bestia truly excels in this department. The Salumi platter, featuring a mix of Italian and Spanish-style cured meats, was a standout. Paired with housemade pickles and mustard, each bite offered a burst of flavors—smoky, tangy, and perfectly balanced. The craftsmanship behind the cured meats was evident, and this dish alone is worth the visit. The antipasti offerings are a great way to start the meal, setting the tone for what’s to come.\n\nPizzas: Classic with a Twist\nThe pizzas at Bestia are another highlight and come highly recommended. We tried the Margherita, with its classic combination of San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, olive oil, and sea salt. Simple yet perfect, the flavors were incredibly fresh, and the dough had just the right amount of chew and char. Best of all, $1 from every Margherita pizza goes to Alex's Lemonade Foundation for Childhood Cancer, adding a feel-good element to an already delicious dish.\n\nThe Burrata pizza was equally delightful, featuring San Marzano tomatoes, Castelvetrano olives, oregano, fermented chilies, and, of course, creamy burrata. The combination of flavors was both comforting and surprising, with the fermented chilies adding a unique, slightly spicy twist that elevated the entire dish. For anyone who loves pizza, Bestia’s offerings are a must-try.\n\nPasta: Buckwheat Tagliatelle\nThe pasta at Bestia is where things get truly exceptional. The Buckwheat Tagliatelle was a revelation—perfectly cooked with an al dente texture that held up beautifully to the rich mushroom ragu. The dish was enhanced with fresh thyme, a sous vide egg that added a luxurious creaminess, fried basil for a bit of crunch, and a hint of chili oil that brought just the right amount of heat. The complexity of flavors and textures made this dish one of the standouts of the evening. It’s a must-order for any pasta lover visiting Bestia.\n\nMain Course: Slow Roasted Lamb Neck\nThe true star of our meal, however, was the Slow Roasted Lamb Neck. This dish was nothing short of spectacular. The lamb neck was slow-roasted to perfection, tender and falling off the bone with the slightest touch. It was served with a smoked anchovy crème fraîche, which added a subtle smoky and umami depth that perfectly complemented the rich flavor of the lamb. The gem lettuce and fresh herbs provided a refreshing contrast, balancing the richness of the dish. Each bite was a harmonious blend of flavors that left us utterly satisfied. If there’s one dish you absolutely cannot miss at Bestia, it’s this one—it’s that delicious.\n\nWine and Dessert\nBestia also offers a great selection of wines, carefully curated to complement the menu, with options available at reasonable prices. Whether you’re a wine connoisseur or simply looking to enjoy a good glass with your meal, you’ll find something to suit your taste here. Though we were tempted by the fantastic dessert menu, we were too full to indulge further. That said, from what we saw and heard from other tables, the desserts are equally impressive and worth saving room for.\n\nOverall, Bestia delivers on all fronts: incredible food, outstanding service, and a lively atmosphere that makes every visit memorable. With its expertly crafted dishes—from the antipasti and pizzas to the standout pasta and lamb neck—this restaurant is a must-visit for anyone in Los Angeles. The attention to detail and passion for quality ingredients are evident in every bite. Highly recommended!"", 'Fantastic! This place keeps being in the top 5 in the entire LA area.

Everything I’ve tried here is great. I do miss the Little Piggy (so please bring it back!!). While the food is what you come for, the real star is the staff. I’ve had Lokahi a number of times & he is absolutely fantastic. The first time I came he made the most incredible suggestions even for ones I was nervous to try. He nailed it & some have become my favorites. It is always such a delight when we come & see his smiling face. You are in the best hands when you’re with him. From the front reception folks’ kindness to the folks delivering the door, it’s just a friendly atmosphere all around. Do yourself a favor & come try this place!!', 'My second time eating here and what a delight. Modern “California” cuisine with accents of Mediterranean and others. Bright and vegetable forward dishes, and some of the best goat dishes I’ve had in the city. Menu changes every 2 months but there’s a couple like the goat neck which hasn’t changed much. Cocktail menu is excellent, it’s one of the few trendy restaurants in LA that exceeds the mark.', ""I loved the ambiance and would come back for brunch, but dinner didn't wow me. A lot of strong flavors yet nothing was particularly memorable to us. Our last course took a long time, someone (not our server) had to come ask if we were still waiting on something. My spa day drink was nice and refreshing, but the goat fashioned was too strong and too sweet, went mostly untouched. We were sat under a fan or ac and I wished I'd brought a jacket. Otherwise it's a nice place to dine out if the menu appeals to you!""]"
The Factory Kitchen,4.5,948,"['The outside looks absolutely terrifying, but once you go inside, the relaxed ambiance and industrial setting give it a unique vibe that’s surprisingly cozy.

Overall, good food, good vibes. Definitely worth a visit.', 'Came to celebrate my grandma’s birthday and the staff was incredible.

Would come back for a special celebration again, they were great!', 'I found this place by accident as my business partner and I had an appointment nearby so we stopped in for lunch. I’m from the south so I don’t trust the way many people from Cali cook steaks. When I tell you it was one of the best steaks of my life, I mean it. I had an actual flashback to a time my dad cooked steaks for the family after we spent the day cutting grass and doing yard work. It was perfect! I asked for medium rare and they actually cooked it correctly. It was hands down beautiful. This is the type of place you take a woman when you’re about to ask her to marry you. It’s the best place in Southern California, and I’d bet every dollar on that.', 'Unfortunately, does not live up to the hype. Dining experience was not the most pleasant. Made to wait until the party fully arrived to be seated even with a reservation. However there is no waiting space and they told us to wait outside in the hallway. The actual dining tables are crammed next to each other. Too close. Waiting is long for the waiter to get to you. Once orders are in, though, the time it takes for food to arrive is decent. The food itself, however, is nothing special. Perfectly fine, but I wouldn’t say worthy of Bib Gourmand recognition. Ordered almost all of the menu staples as recommended by the staff, but not impressed by any.', 'Our experience at The Factory Kitchen was amazing from start to finish.\n\nWe were seated immediately, and servers were very attentive, quickly refilling drinks, clearing plates, and bringing new silverware for each course. Menus are printed daily, which we thought was a nice touch to make the experience even more special. The kitchen is open, so we were able to see fresh pasta being made, prosciutto being sliced, and food being cooked.\n\nThe highlights of our meal were the Prosciutto, the Gnocchi Malfatti, and the Canoli.\n\nI will be sure to come back any time I find myself in the Los Angeles area, and will advise anyone I know traveling here to visit as well.']"

Indoor dining only. Valet parking available as well as street parking. We split the charcuterie board, little gem salad, porcini rubbed short ribs, pollo a la diavola, beef and bone marrow pie, broccolini, and pane Bianco. Definitely not the restaurant to go to when you’re a vegan/vegetarian. The food was all rich and very tasty. My favorites were the short ribs and the pollo. The food came out as it was ready. Our waiter was effusive and everyone checked in frequently. There was one table that good for a big group. We had leftovers for the following day which still kept well. We had the chocolate tart for dessert and they gave us complimentary spoonfuls of strawberry gelato.

It was very exciting for us.\n\nThe atmosphere was fantastic. We got here around 6pm, so it wasn’t too loud yet and we were able to have an intimate dinner.\n\nAppetisers were amazing - we got the oysters and the Portuguese octopus. It was very fresh and delicious.\n\nEntrees, on the other hand, were alright. Both filet mignon  and papa-deli pasta came out lukewarm. Both the taste and presentation was a little underwhelming comparing to the bar set by the appetiser. It wasn’t not delicious but there are plenty of places with better tastes.\n\nService was amicable, they payed attention to details very well. Valet was 14$, which isn’t unexpected but still quite absurd. The bill comes out 200$+ for two people and for the palette quality, I wouldn’t say it was worth it.\n\nOverall experience was quite mid, wouldn’t recommend for or against nor come back anytime soon.', 'Romantic and very reminiscent of a Parisian dining experience, this little gem was a delectable experience. Well-plated, the pasta was divine, the fish cooked perfectly. From impeccable service right down to the coffee, I would make the hour and a half long trek once more for a meal here.', 'Charming, inconspicuous restaurant perfect for celebrating a special occasion. Overall ambiance is peaceful and encourages comfortable conversations, as observed by us and most tables surrounding ours.\n\nThe menu is tastefully curated and the portion sizes left us feeling satiated. I started with a Yuzu Toki Highball drink, which tasted silky with a lingering touch of sweetness. For our appetizer we went with the Burrata and it was delightful, with interesting texture in every bite. The sea bass entree was complemented by 3x forms of cauliflower, which felt multi-dimensional yet beautifully simple at the same time. There was a green sauce that really made the entire meal. Surprising elements throughout, such as raisins and peppercorns, added a nice touch. The rack of lambs entree was well seasoned and juicy.\n\nStaff was attentive, knowledgeable, and efficient. Our total after tip was ~$80/person so I wouldn’t come here routinely, but the overall experience is nice for something worth celebrating.']"

Angelini Osteria,4.5,1067,"['Excellent food, excellent service, and in a warm and cozy atmosphere. Angelini Osteria knows what they’re doing and has been making great Italian food for years.

There wasn’t a lot of people yet, the restaurant still feels intimate while being lively. Towards the end of our meal it has gotten a loooot more packed and noisy. Depending on the vibe and noise level you’re looking for, time plays a huge role in it.\n\nThe octopus salad was insanely good. Big fan. Sooo delicious.

Maybe the pasta was a bit too al dente but that sauce made up for it. Must try place near the grove. The place is packed so get a reservation and be prepared to wait but well worth it.', 'We had high hopes for Angelini, and while the food was pretty good, between the steep prices and not so friendly service, the overall experience was disappointing. We could tell all the pasta dishes were not made fresh as the noodles felt they were cooked from a box and the plates came out heated. The servers were attentive but gave off unfriendly, stressed and annoyed vibes. The ambiance for a restauranf charging $32 more more for a small pasta dish was lackluster with old tables and dirty floors and a cramped room. Overall if they adjusted their prices and attitudes, would be a decent place to go.', 'Great service by Marie tonight. Had a lovely dinner celebrating my birthday. All of the food was spectacular!

Also when we got there, we couldn’t get a window seat, but we talked to our waiter and during dessert he said we could place you by a window seat so even after a halfway after the meal, they gave us a window seat thank you so much 71above.!!!!', ""This spot deserves more stars until Google recognizes it as a must-visit in downtown LA. I had my birthday dinner here.I'd suggest it mainly for drinks because their food options are limited to a three-course menu. There are two escalators to take you up to a sky-high 71st-floor atmosphere where the drinks and the vibes are incredible. The female bartender whipped up a non-alcoholic margarita for me with lemon perfection! I tried their shrimp appetizer, which has head and tail included and was well cooked with the right flavors of sauce around it. It was impressive, and I could taste the chef's expertise . I would say I liked their almond cake more, with its smooth texture and just the right amount of sweetness. Plus, they add a crunchy topping, which adds a nice touch. I like crunching desserts, which impressed me and the sweet bread below the cake was so smooth. Opt for a window seat for the best experience. There’s an 18% service charge, but it's worth it. Sure, it's a bit pricey, but the food options and quantity might not justify the cost. The view, the vibes it gives, and the food taste are all worth it.""]"

First off, it was during summer and they had all the windows open/doors open to the outside. Normally I wouldn’t mind this, but given that it was summer it made the entire restaurant, including the interior sweltering hot. So much to the point that it was affecting my asthma and making it hard to breathe, which in turn made it difficult to enjoy my meal. The food was not bad, but I would have expected more from a Michelin rated restaurant. Better than Olive Garden but not as good as other Italian restaurants I’ve tried. And then the kicker was at the end of my meal I got hit with a 20% automatic gratuity. This was listed nowhere on the menu and no other restaurant I dined at in LA did this. The service was very poor- I barely got drink refills and I had to get my own to-go boxes because our waiter never came back to check on us. Definitely not worth a 20% gratuity.', 'This place is such a beautiful restaurant and the ambience is very romantic. I ordered the squid ink risotto and my partner ordered the black and white pasta, both were very delicious and we were satisfied with our main.

The fruit side was also perfectly balanced with the right amounts of strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, cantaloupe, and honeydew.\n\nCarrot Cake -\xa0 I'm a huge fan of carrot cake, and this ranks among the best I've had. Moist, but not too moist, smoothly sweet and adorned with raisins and walnuts. I don't usually like walnuts, but these were not bitter and retained their crunchiness while allowing the walnut flavor to enhance the profile without domination. Cream cheese frosting was smooth and buttery. The perfect finish to an almost perfect meal.""]"

When we were seated, we had a fun patio table and enjoyed a great vibe with Dustin. He did not miss a beat by not only grabbing an extra glass of bubbly for our wait but… double checking the tablet list of ingredients with the kitchen. It was seriously a dream come true. I felt like I didn’t have to second guess my concerns I also felt like we were the most important guests in the moment even though all guests were. The menu is exciting but try atmosphere even more so and the dessert left my gluten-free cake lovers dream wanting to come back.

Thank you Tiffany and Dustin, we can’t wait to return!', 'We were in the area and stopped by for lunch. The place seems to be very popular, judging by how busy it was. The atmosphere is nice and the service was great. We ordered a Cobb Salad and the Mediterranean Salad. The salads were good, but their prices are a little excessive for the portions and quality. Their salads average 20 to 30 each. Cocktail drinks are, on average $13 to 19 each. Overall, a good experience for a once in a while.', 'Joey’s is a nice dinner place to treat yourself to some high quality food.

My friends and I ordered the following: Szechuan chicken lettuce wraps, Szechuan tofu lettuce wraps, Korean fried cauliflower, steak and ravioli bianco, and the Mediterranean bowl.

San Laurel,4.5,199,"[""First off, this restaurant is a bit hard to find after parking, I had to ask the security to help us find this place, but once you're there, it's just beautiful.

Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar,4.5,1515,"[""I went to Fleming's before a concert at the Peacock Theater in LA Live. I love steakhouses and dine at them regularly, and I would consider this a good steakhouse overall. The food was really good and the cocktails were nice and balanced. We had a bit of an issue with getting seated and serviced initially, but the service definitely improved throughout the dining experience. It was a bit louder than I would say a typical steakhouse is, but I assume that's the area it's located and the fact that there were events in L.A. Live. I would want to come back to try it out again."", 'The service & food is always top notch here!  Depending on how you feel, dining in the bar area is always a winner.

It was fantastic food and a great experience. Our table split a couple sharable sides.\n\nThe first item was the Fleming's Potatoes, which to me was a very rich and flavorful au gratin type of dish.\n\nThe second item was the crab cakes. I have never had a crab cake before, and I think these spoiled them from here on out. They were jam packed with crab, seared perfectly, and the red pepper and lime sauce was perfect with them.\n\nThe third item was the flash fried brussels sprouts. I have had brussels sprouts before, but these were the best I have ever had. The crispy texture, along with the sauce that was on it was perfect. I can only guess what was on them, but it tasted like balsamic vinaigrette with either honey or brown sugar. I will have to try and figure out how to cook these at home!\n\nFor dinner I had the Main Filet Mignon with the Diablo Shrimp on top. The steak was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth!\n\nAccompanying dinner they served nice fresh bread with 2 different butters. The first one was a champagne infused butter, and the second was a cheddar and herb butter. Both were fantastic, but if I had to choose I would take the champagne butter any day.\n\nThe other two dishes we had was the Petite Filet Mignon and the Miso-Glazed Chilean Sea Bass. I do not have pictures of those two dishes, but I was told that both dishes were fantastic!\n\nI would return here again, but I would reserve it for a special occasion or anniversary. It is fantastic food, just not something that can be afforded on a regular basis."", 'Josh and Trey were fantastic, very attentive, very knowledgeable and gave me great recommendations and answered all of my questions.

Bavel,4.6,1574,"['Been meaning to come here for a long time and was not disappointed.  Everything was expertly crafted and every detail seemed to be thought out. Our favorites were the duck hummus and the crayfish. The lamb neck shawarma could have fed 4 people, and was so decadent.  Definitely coming back!', 'Bavel has been on my must-try list here in LA for a while now. The food is truly exceptional; you simply cannot go wrong ordering anything on the menu. Definitely get the zucchini blossoms, shawarma, babaghanoush. The pita is extremely well done.\n\nThe downsides are service + ambience. When I initially arrived, the hostess was quite diffident. Gave me a menu and said someone will take my drink order as I stood waiting in the heat. Why couldn’t they just tell me to wait by the bar where it is shaded? They then seated us outside, even when I had requested an inside table on the reservation. And the table backed up real closely to other patrons. I think service has become such a rarity in newer establishments. I get it. It’s busy on a Tuesday night, but the real lack of hospitality just didn’t sit right with me.\n\nOur main waiter was decent and attentive, thankfully. That initial experience still set the tone of the meal for me though. Looking forward to a better service experience next time.', 'Bavel features a stylish and vibrant interior that seamlessly blends modern design with cozy warmth.

As for the food, each plate is a visual feast, thoughtfully crafted with fresh ingredients and vibrant spices that truly stand out.', ""There was so much we loved the look of on the menu, and everything we tried was delicious! So much so we bought a copy of the recipe book for Bavel to try bring some of the experience back to Sydney with us. Make sure to book in to avoid disappointment as it was very busy but the service, quality of meals and vibe  made this one of our favourite parts of our trip to the U.S.A! My photos don't do it justice "", 'Hightlights:\n* The food was pretty unique and tasty.\n* I got food poisoning from eating here. It was so yummy it was possibly worth it, though.\n* If you\'re vegan, you\'re not gonna have a good time\n\nCons:\n* Valet is $13, and there\'s no other easy parking options.\n* They\'re firm on not seating you until your whole party arrives\n* There is a 4% service charge independent of gratuity. You can opt out, but you\'ll probably look like a butt hole.\n* They don\'t do substitutions at all. If you\'re vegan, you have very few options to eat. You can\'t eat any of the entrees and desserts.\n* I got food poisoning from eating here. I am not sure what it was: it could have been the raw fish, the lamb chops, or the ribeye. Maybe it was another dish? I would avoid ordering undercooked meats here going forward.\n* They don\'t really do anything special for your birthday. They don\'t even sing. They just say, ""Oh, happy birthday!"" 🙄\n\nPros:\n* The staff is very friendly and attentive. They refilled our waters very quickly and took away empty plates quickly. They also swapped out our dirty plates for clean plates.\n* The staff are aware of how painful it can be if you have dietary restrictions, so they\'ll do their best to mark the menu and help you find what you can eat\n* Most dishes were unique, tasty, and reasonably priced for a ""nice"" restaurant.\n\nDetails:\n* Duck hummus: meh. The duck flavor isn\'t really that strong, so it overall just tastes like normal hummus.\n* Bluefin crudo: they had bluefin tuna crudo that day as an alternative option available to the dry aged trout crudo. This actually tasted amazing: the sour and slightly sweet sauce that accompanies it perfectly complimented it. It was not bad for $32, but the portion is small. I think this is probably what gave me food poisoning. I still might recommend it despite this - it was that good.\n* Roasted sprouting cauliflower: This was not bad. It had some herbal taste that reminded me of soap.  My vegetarian wife loved it.\n* Oyster mushroom kebab: This is a must try, and it\'s (vegan?). Everyone, including the meat eaters, loved it. The seasoning and texture were perfect. It was neither dry nor soggy, both of which can happen often to pure mushroom dishes. There was supposed an avocado puree, which might not have been dairy free, but we got all sauces on the side, and this mushroom disb without the sauce was perfect as is. Portion is not big, and it was a little pricey at $26, but I highly recommend it.\n* Grilled Prawns: another must try. The sauce is deliciously sweet and spicy, and the shells are mostly removed for you. The flesh was slightly overcooked. It\'s a little pricey at 5 prawns for $33, but I highly recommend it.\n* Grilled Dorade: This was amazing! The seasoning reminds me a little of those cumin meat skewers from Asian street foods. It\'s slightly sweet and slightly spicy. They add some oil to it for richness and texture. They leave the head intact if you enjoy eating that. The meat was tender and mild. It\'s a little smaller fish than I expected, but it\'s actually pretty decently priced at $48. I loved this dish, and I highly recommend it.\n* Lamb Neck Schwarma: The presentation is great, and the portion is huge. It\'s served on a giant flabread. Good deal for $54. It has a cinnamon taste that kind of reminds me of desssrt - it might not be desirable to everyone. The meat is very tender, and it\'s fun to rip off some flatbread and grab the meat with it.\n* Beef Cheek: The meat was so tender. The flavor kind of reminded me of Taiwanese stewed beef for spicy beef noodle soup. The actual portion of beef is not large for $49, but you could probably dip some flatbread in the beef juices to get the most of it. I didn\'t care much for the beets in the dish.\n* Lamb Rack: This was cooked perfectly medium and seasoned perfectly.  I don\'t really like lamb rack, but this one was prepared perfectly. The portion for this is HUGE, so it\'s priced fairly at $89.\n* Bone-in Ribeye: disappointing. We asked and were told it\'d be medium cooked, and it came out medium rare. The seasoning is meh.']"

The corn tostada was a standout, with its crunchy texture and well-balanced sweet and tangy flavors. The lamb chops were cooked to perfection, but the accompanying Moroccan relish was a bit too salty for my taste. The chilaqueles were decent, although the short rib could have been a bit more tender.\n\nWhile the food was generally good, the service was a bit slow because there was only one person doing both - taking orders and serving the food. Overall, Running Goose is a decent option for a casual meal in Los Angeles, but there are likely better choices for those seeking exceptional service.', ""This place is amazing! It sits in the middle of a restaurant row near the Hollywood Pantages. It is easy to drive or walk past it because of its unassuming facade. But please don't! This is a wonderful little gem! From the service to the ambiance, the affordability, and the delectable food they serve, I am surprised it isn't more popular than it is. There were quite a few menu offerings that were intriguing, and had we been hungrier, we would have ordered more. What we did order and enjoyed did not disappoint. Come with people you dont mind sharing food with. The food will definitely get everyone in your party talking and bonding over the flavors and presentation.

We ordered the cod churros, they were very crispy on the outside and soft/flaky on the inside. Nice texture and flavor. Not too fishy and not too dry or hard. We also got the calamari, which came with a pepper sauce. It had a fresh flavor with a burst of pepper but not spicy at all, which we loved. Calamari itself was just okay. Light and airy batter. I ordered the salmon, which they said would be medium, which is great. It was a bit more on the well done side with a sliver of pink on the inside. Crispy outside skin which I enjoyed. The risotto it came was was pretty good and the mushrooms were the best thing. Almost like they were pickled, but delicious.\nWe got the horchata creme brulee which came out warm, a bit runny but so good. My only dislike was the blueberries - it would\'ve been perfect without them. Just my opinion. We also got the bread pudding. Came out hot and everything was perfectly sweet and not overdone.

We got lucky that we asked to just scoot down a bit so we wouldn\'t feel like we were imposing on the other diners there.\nThey said they have valet parking for $20 but the parking spaces are tiny and there are other lots and street parking in the area, you might just have to drive around to find something but being Hollywood, that\'s a given.', ""That patio was fully shaded so it was still comfortable when 83 outside.

I wasn\'t clear if this meant tap water or purchasing bottled water for a fee, so I asked and it was the latter. Felt a little slippery to me. Also, our entrees took a lot longer than what was communicated to us, but I think that\'s because when we sat down the place was nearly empty and 20 minutes later it was busy.

Each dish is a work of art, beautifully arranged and often accompanied by whimsical elements that make the dining experience feel special. It's clear that a lot of thought goes into how the food is served, which adds to the excitement of the meal.\n\n**Food:**\nWhile the presentation was top-notch, the food itself was just okay. Some dishes were flavorful, but others fell a bit flat compared to the stunning visuals. It felt like the emphasis was more on the aesthetics than on delivering a consistently delicious meal.\n\n**Service:**\nThe service was excellent. The staff was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. They made sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive, which enhanced our overall experience.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nThe atmosphere at Barton G is vibrant and lively. The decor is fun and engaging, making it a great place for celebrations or a night out. The energy in the restaurant really adds to the enjoyment of the meal.\n\n### Overall Impression\nBarton G is a feast for the eyes and a fun place to dine, but if you're looking for exceptional food, it might not fully satisfy. Still, with its excellent service and great atmosphere, it’s worth a visit for the overall experience."", ""I couldn't have been more pleased by the uniqueness of the whole dining experience for my birthday.

District,4.3,504,"['We had the BEST bartender for our whole stay in Los Angeles! My husband and I were guests at the hotel and we stopped in a few nights during our stay to enjoy some cocktails.

All around, great drinks, super friendly bartenders and drinks so good you’ll wish you could thank the man who made your rounds. Order the Photo Op! Cheers!', 'Great place for after work cocktails and shared plates. Service was awesome and check out the drinks! You can even give them one of your photos and they will put it on your drink', 'So distrustful of Google reviews after this experience. Thought a 4.3 rating was a safe bet. Ordered the ribeye, truly awful - seasoning must have been Lowry’s, had sludge around it, and I’d bet it was the lowest quality grade beef.  I was too tired to get up and leave after the server said “the kitchen isn’t too good at temperatures” since that was an obvious red flag, but again, I trusted Google and had just walked a half mile from my hotel.\n\nI also didn’t realize District was attached to the Sheraton or I would never have sought a good meal here. The happy hour beer menu was a single beer below Modelo quality.\n\nAvoid this place.', 'Food tasted pretty good. Huge chunks of crab in the crab cakes.  The service was good and very attentive. Ambiance was great because they had on the NBA FINALS.  They charge an automatic 20% gratuity. The only steak was a ribeye. I wish they had a filet mignon.', 'I saw that this spot had great food reviews and I’ve been here in the past for a drink or two, so I decided to stop by for the entree offerings.\n\nI had their Crispy fish tacos, angry chicken sandwich with truffle Parmesan fries, and a tres leches cake followed by a vanilla ice cream.\n\nThe fish taco was phenomenal, mainly because of the sauce and the type of tortilla it had. My only critique was, I wish it were crispier, the fish tasted like it was fried before and then just reheated. Overall it was one of the best crispy fist tacos I’ve ever had, if I retry it again with a more crispier fish, I’d put it at the top.\n\nNow the angry chicken sandwich was also very delicious, I love that they used thigh meat because you can taste the flavor difference.  The truffle fries that came with it was ok, and didn’t really bring out the truffle permesan flavor too much and it wasn’t too crispy either.\n\nThe tres leches cake was also very phenomenal, but I don’t consider this a traditional tres leches as compared to the ones I’ve had at La Monarca etc. It was more of a delicious dry cake but lacked the milky/wet/extra moist characteristics that I thought it would have. The ice cream was a nice touch to kind of fill that part.\n\nI’d definitely come back here again and it looks like an excellent place during the night. Parking is covered but I don’t know if this spot validates, either way it’s worth the trip.']"

Le Grand Restaurant,4.0,655,"['The perfect place to eat for indecisive diners (like me). Le Grand has tapas style dining in a contemporary, comfortable downtown location and offers one of the best values in the area. We enjoyed the $50 unlimited tapas option (and $30 unlimited drinks). We had 2 hours to try a dozen small plates and they really kept them coming with fast, attentive service.\n\nLucky for me, there were plenty of vegetarian options, some were hits and some were misses for me, but not because of recipe execution, I just had the opportunity to try some things I might not have were it not for the unlimited option.\n\nThe hummus, cauliflower steak, and watermelon salad were among my favorites. The veggie bombs were a little much for me, I could have done with just one, or smaller balls. And although not included in the fixed pricing, the deserts were a great way to finish our meal.', 'This place was a nice surprise for brunch. They have a great pricing plan with a big diversity of foods. I was honestly expecting low quality on food and drinks cause there is no way they are making money on this. But it was honestly much better than expected. I say the drink package is totally worth it alone as there were high quality cocktails made very well and made sure you had a great time. Service was staff was impeccable. My only gripe was the AC does not really spread across the entire venue (it was a really hot day out) but once we got those cocktails going that helped us cool down a bit on our patio seats. Thanks for a good time Le Grand!', ""2024 Eats, LA #4: came here Friday just minutes before happy hour ended. They quickly seated us, but it took quite a while for a waiter to come to our table. I assumed they were intentionally trying to wait for the happy hour hour to end.\n\nWhen our server finally came, they told us they'd be able to honor the happy hour 5x$25 deal. As a party of four, we ordered 10 items: poke x2,  coconut curry mussels, salmon, garlic mushrooms chicken parm, ribs, brisket, Adjarian khachapuri, and veggie puri.\n\nDrink-wise we ordered two bottles of cab sauv $39/ea and four beers $7/ea.\n\nWhile the food didn't blow us away, it was pretty good (especially when considering the price). The standout for me was the khachapuri--would definitely order again. The rest was mostly average to above average.  The cab was from Mendocino and quite good. The beers they offer on tap are all solid, and again the price of the drinks is great for dtla. I couldn't find a cocktail on their menu that interested me, but their beer and wine more than sufficed.\n\nOur various waiters were all very nice and friendly, but it was quite chaotic and it often took a few asks to get things. They all made up for that, though, by being friendly and personable, so it wasn't an issue at all.\n\nVibe-wise, it was kind of odd as they were taking photos for social media which was distracting. The restaurants had a wide array of folks from young people enjoying happy hour, to families, to people celebrating birthdays.\n\nWhile I'm not rushing to come back, I think Le Grand's new menu/happy hour offers value, and I would come back."", ""Ambiance: we went on a not so sunny day, but inside was bustling with energy.

Super friendly and helpful, no complaints at all.\n\nFood: a little apprehensive about all you can eat places but this place was really good, I didn't like everything which I expected but most of the items I chose were delicious and hot.

The sweet tartness of passion fruit melding in unison with the herbaceous dill. Really a special dish.\n\nNext up we had the Mushroom Crispy Rice. It’s a signature dish for a reason.

Fried Cauliflower- I love cauliflower so this dish was a must. The pineapple vinaigrette was a nice touch!\n\n4. Sugar Snap Peas- texture was amazing and the lemon vinaigrette were perfect.\n\n5.

The crust they place is the highlight in my opinion. Very well seasoned and arranged well.\n\nThe lobster Mac and cheese was delicious. It could have had a bit more lobster, but it was still a good dish. Just add a little pepper and You're good to go.\n\nClam chowder and oysters were very delicious, not much more to say.  The bar staff is extremely friendly. The service alone is worth coming back for. The ambiance was very nice, no Loud music, sports on the television, just an overall good vibe.\n\nOverall, great experience at this location, I'd definitely revisit."", 'One of the best catering service. The catering manager Lismarie is really helpful and wonderful. I’ve had catered our lunch meeting from this place twice last year and today.

Keep up the good work, highly recommend to call them for any catering services. 👍🏻', 'Amazing atmosphere, incredible steaks, and amazing customer service. Connie was our dedicated waiter. She made some amazing recommendations on all entrees including a delicious lobster bisque, a well prepared steak and a delicious dessert.\n\nConnie took amazing care of us and her sense of humor was superb. Would definitely come back and request her specifically.', ""My partner and I have visited this wonderful restaurant twice now, and on both occasions the food and service have been beyond exceptional.\n\nOur first visit was last month for my birthday. We were originally due to go to another restaurant but were recommended by friends to go to the Capital Grille instead  We are so happy that we took their advice. From the moment we stepped through the door, the whole evening was just wonderful. We were looked after by the lovely Stephanie. She was absolutely incredible. Her service was impeccable and she has the most lovely manner. She really loves her job and this certainly shines through.\n\nA birthday note along with some table decorations were laid out for our arrival. A lovely and welcoming touch.\n\nThe interior and ambience of the restaurant is beautiful and the food was absolutely outstanding and thoughtfully presented. My partner is actually vegetarian and ordered a selection of sides along with the French onion soup which she said is the best she has ever tasted. We were also offered some 'off menu' vegetarian options which was amazing considering this is predominantly a steak house. The evening was topped off by a wonderful birthday desert and a chat with the manager, Lismarie, who wanted to say “hi” and check we enjoyed our evening. How many managers do that!\n\nDue to such a memorable evening, we popped in last week on a whim. We hoped to see Stephanie again but she was taking care of a private dining party. She did take the time to talk to us though and left us in the hands of her lovely colleague Alie whose service style, again, was incredible.\n\nAlie was amazing and also offered a selection of 'off menu' vegetarian options. My partner had a tasty vegetarian pasta dish and I had the salmon. It was so full of flavour and cooked to perfection by the wonderful and talented chef, Laura. We got to meet chef Laura at the end of the evening which was a lovely experience. The whole team are like a family who all work together to create this amazing restaurant.\n\nWe really cannot speak highly enough of this fabulous restaurant and would definitely recommend a visit. As well as the beautiful dining area there is a very inviting bar which is very popular.\n\nPs. The onion bread and the creme brûlée are out of this world!\n\nThank you to all the team at the Capital Grille Downtown and we look forward to our next visit ☺️"", ""Went for a company team-building dinner. Service is exceptional! Our server was very knowledgeable and even offered items from a secret menu!\n\nI ordered the Chef's Suggestion Porcini Rubbed Bone-In Ribeye with 15-Year Aged Balsamic with New England Clam Chowder. The chowder was excellent with the oyster crackers. The crunchy cracker texture contrasted very well with the very creamy clams in the chowder. The ribeye serving was huge and cooked just as I asked (medium rare). However, I wasn't a big fan of the porcini mushroom crust and balsamic on the ribeye. It sounded good on the menu. I expected the mushroom crust and balsamic to give substantial extra flavor but I was disappointed. The ribeye steak was still good but just not as flavorful as I thought. In hindsight, I was thinking I probably should have just ordered the regular ribeye without the mushroom crust and without the balsamic. Maybe next time!\n\nOh, and the lobster mac and cheese side is highly recommended!\n\nUpdate 7/16/2024: Went here again for lunch. Had the regular 14oz Ribeye steak this time. Much better than the dinner Ribeye steak with mushroom crust and balsamic. The cheesecake was so good too for dessert!""]"

We sat in the outdoor area. We ordered two different veggie pizzas and bread sticks (kinda pricey). There wasn’t much to choose from on the menu.

We parked directly at the curb next to the entrance of the outdoor eating area. It’s metered parking. We had to add coins every 15 minutes… it only allowed 15 minutes before it capped out 👀.

The day’s special was duck foie gras (urged by my friend to order), pretty fresh, but lacked the magic of driving one to crave for it. The salad was nicely done, a good respite from the otherwise very hearty French cuisine. Our fav of the night was the beef bourguignon - rich, deep, and complex flavor from beef and a hint of wine (made me want to try making it one more time at home). The lemon pie was definitely the signature dessert - dreamy mascarpone cream on top of very lemony crust.', 'Discovered this absolute gem of a French restaurant on South Robertson Boulevard while on a long walk around different sections of the city.

I’m particularly sensitive with noise and found that the front section was in earshot of passing traffic, however, upon being inside in the main entrance transported into warm and welcoming ambiance of black and white photos hung on the wall, unusual artifacts similar to the clock pictured, and distinct furnishings that were also used for utensils and needed items.\n\nI was greeted promptly even though busy on a Saturday night and dining solo which has its challenges was met with a few options for a welcoming stay in which I chose a private like table near the hall leading towards the kitchen.\n\nServers were prompt with taking order along with a quick turnaround in bringing to the table. Also, upon completion of meal removing finished plates and silverware.

All were succulent and amazingly delicious!!! I savored every morsel and spoonful embracing the moments of exceptional taste and quality. Truly magnificent seasonings, texture, and portions that were perfectly sized.\n\nThe atmosphere was filled with great energy.

Credit cards accepted.\n\nWe got the cheese and charcuterie board which seemed to be a popular order. There were three different cheeses and three different meats, with the portions smaller than expected but there was a variety, so it wasn’t too much of a loss. The loaded fries were really rich and I got that for my meal, but had a lot for leftovers the following day. The mussel pasta was super buttery and rich, which in my book was a plus.\n\nUnfortunately they were out of the chocolate creme du pot so I was sad about that. We used a gift card and had $10 left which we wanted to apply it towards part of the tip, but apparently management doesn’t allow tips to be taken from gift cards.

Sqirl,4.4,1416,"['This place was busy my entire visit and for good reason. It has a really cool artisanal shop next door of jams, and unique groceries. Dining on their patio was very “LA”.

I think my main issue with Sqirl is that their dishes are beautifully presented, but the looks bear stronger than the taste. I found the dishes were hit or miss. While we LOVED the seasonal frittata and the latka, the pesto bowl and ricotta toast were lacking. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a pretty place to grab lunch with friends, you can tell a lot of effort was put into the interior. Just not sure if it reaches my top brunch spots in LA. I could foresee myself coming back to try the pastries or cake (which looked delicious), but for the full sit down brunch thing, it might be awhile before I come back.', ""All I can say is wow.

Also, some of the dishes tasted too buttery, but they were still edible. The cornbread would have been better if it were hotter. The lobster pieces in the pasta could have been more tender. I think my favorite dishes were the scallops and the snapper. Service was great. The dishes came out quickly', 'I enjoyed every aspect of our dinner here - the minimalist but classy decor, the casual yet elevated vibe, and the delicious food all came together for a great experience. The menu was fantastic, and we ended up with additional dishes based on what the chef had whipped up that night; the focaccia plate that came out was really something special.\n\nMy partner got the wine pairing which was a lovely supplement of wines and sake to go along with the meal and definitely well worth it. We also got the seafood porridge supplement and cannot emphasize enough how much I’d recommend it! The seafood is perfect and goes extremely well with the risotto it comes with - it’s savory, creamy, and all around excellent.', 'We had recently gone to Orsa and Winston for a birthday. The entrance is not flashy and easily missed from the street and the restaurant itself only has a handful of tables set up. With that said, the food was immaculate.

I haven't been to this BOA location in like 10 years so it was long overdue. My wife made reservations and put we were celebrating a birthday. When we arrived to the place, we did the valet parking in front of the restaurant. It's credit card only with the valet so be aware of that. We then walked into the restrauant and checked in, they took us to our table right away. The inside of the restrauant is very nice, exclusive and feel like a luxury place. When we got seated our waiter Abbey came to greet us and told us about their special today. She took our drinks order which was just soda with free refills because I asked since at another place they didn't tell me it wasn't free refills. We already knew what we wanted so when she came back with our drinks, we put in our order. My wife got the Chilean Sea Bass because she was deciding between that or the Linguine with Clams but Abbey said the Sea Bass was a better choice. I went with the Filet center cut at medium with the peppercorn sauce since you get 1 free sauce. We also got regular fries and original Mac & cheese. Our entree came out first and then they brought out the sides after. My filet mignon was delicious, cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. The peppercorn sauce was good as well but I like my filet more without it. My wife totally loved her Sea Bass, just wish it was a bigger portion because it was delicious. My fries was great as well because I'm more of a French fries person and my wife enjoyed her Mac & cheese. All of the employees here are amazing, they will keep an eye on your table and if there any mess or finished plates then they'll come take care of it. The owner stopped by and ask us about our experience to which we told him we were having an amazing time. We ended the night with a carrot cake that Abbey brought out to us and it was good as well since I never had a carrot cake. I would recommend coming here if you want to try a great steakhouse. We didn't have any issues with the valet and I checked my car hidden dashcam where it records the inside of the car to which the valet driver was respectful since I saw other reviews with bad experiences. They also charge a labor subcharge here so be aware but it's not too bad."", ""Boa Steakhouse is the best restaurant I’ve ever dined at. The atmosphere was incredibly welcoming, and the food was amazing. Our server, Jay, went above and beyond to make our dining experience exceptional.

Despite the restaurant’s busyness, Angel managed to provide us with timely and personalized attention, which we greatly appreciated.\n\nFood:\nThe menu at BOA offers a variety of high-quality options, and we indulged in a range of dishes. Here’s what we ordered:\n\n•\tSpaghetti & Meatballs ($42): The spaghetti was cooked al dente and were really tasty but the meatballs were a little bland. The dish was beautifully presented with a garnish of herbs.  The meatballs claimed to be wagu beef but I couldn't taste the difference between that and normal meatballs.\n•\tOrganic Half Chicken ($42): A perfectly roasted dish with juicy meat, it offered a delightful blend of crisp skin and tender inside.\n•\tSalmon ($42): Cooked to perfection, the salmon had a crispy exterior with a moist, flaky interior, complemented well by the side it was served with.\n•\tGrilled Lamb ($68): The lamb was seared beautifully and bursting with flavor, served with just the right amount of char. It was one of the highlights of the night.\n•\tBrussels Sprouts & Bacon ($16) and Asparagus ($16): The side dishes were a lovely complement to our main courses, especially the crispy Brussels sprouts which had a nice balance of flavors.\n•\tNouveau Cheesecake ($16): For dessert, we shared a slice of cheesecake that was smooth and rich, a perfect way to end the meal.\n\nThe total came to $329.52 after taxes, including a $12 discount. There was also a 4.5% WEHO labor surcharge, which seems common for restaurants in the area.\n\nOverall:\nBOA Steakhouse delivers a fantastic dining experience that combines excellent service, a sophisticated ambiance, and delicious food.

Shame we don’t live closer as it would definitely be a weekly staple. All the food was delicious. Some were not very traditionally Indian, but the twist on them didn’t stop the flavours. It was very busy during the lunchtime we were there. The server was on his own but worked very hard to accommodate everyone.', 'I have been wanting to try this place for quite awhile now. The food was overall good. I will say the fish for the fish moilee was a little undercooked. The scaly side was not crisp and it was also hard to cut into. But the curry sauce was phenomenal. Samosas and their sauces were super tasty. The yogurt puffs were bite size and fun to bite into. The saag paneer was also full of flavor and did not disappoint. I will say the roti was a little different than what I am used to. A little bit on the tougher side compared to the flaky and light rotis I’ve had in the past. Overall 4/5', 'So you “Could” come here and have a nice meal, and get out the door for around $35.  But I would recommend you budget in the range of $50-60 per person, because you’re going to want to try everything!  Samosas bigger than your clenched fist, fried fish with wonderful sauce, Tikka Masala with a hint of spice, and Indian inspired poutine are a few of the dishes you’ll want to try.   Portion sizes for the entrees allow everyone to order something different and share communally amongst the table.

Although it comes with one side (the portion was large) they suggested I split the sides and get two different options. The rice and  mashed potatoes were amazing. The mashed potatoes weren’t grainy AT ALL. The steak was packed with flavor and cooked to my liking. There was too much garlic for my preference but it did not taint the flavor, I just removed them to the side.\nMy boyfriend loved it here as well and he’s an extremely picky eater.\nWe will come back!', ""Very nice I will be back again. Good place to get a good steak at a reasonable price. DTLA most steak places are $100 per person which is fine for a night out but who wants to pay that for lunch? I got a nice lunch size ribeye with two sides i chose rice and salad. The salad was solid but the rice was like butter that melted in my mouth! Next time I will get rice and one of the other sides I'm excited to see what they do with it. The steak was very tender and cooked just to order, it needed a pinch of sea salt and it would have been nearly perfect. Next time I'll probably get the bigger one. I got in and out quick and under $40 including tip! That is excellent for DTLA. You can easily pay that much for a burger and fries. I know because I have."", ""Great customer service. We ordered the table de carnes (NY strip, skirt steak, tenderloins). The first time around, our steaks were well done (we ordered medium rare) but the manager was very nice about it and he had the order re-done. It was much better after that, for our liking. Waitstaff checked on us multiple times, also. On the side we had zucchini and fries. We also tried flan and lemon cake for dessert. If you ever find yourself downtown, this is a good spot. There's a public pay parking lot across the street on Main (cost tonight was $10). Next time, we'd like to try the ribeye.""]"

Had the opportunity to sit down at the bar and experience what can only be described as a beautiful harmonious dance between the chef the cooks and theirs stoves and ovens. I had the escargot as an appetizer, that garlic parsley butter was to die for, I only wish the baguette it was served with wasn’t as heavy as it was, it needed more air and a bit more salt (Maybe find another baker?). For the main course I had Filet Aux Poivre and it was phenomenal, perfectly seared and tender, topped with that silky smooth creamy peppercorn sauce with a slightly sweet profile provided by the cognac it was made with.

I paired every dish with a wine or amaro. With tax and 20% tip, it came out to $170 or so. Service was exceptional and convivial. Staff, be it kitchen or FoH, were delighted to know you\'re delighted. Every empty plate was cleared within a minute of finishing the dish.

I was extremely full and didn’t think I had room for dessert, but the dessert was so good and refresh light I ended up finishing it.\n\nThe Korean Sool Pairing was excellent and I would highly recommend it. It consisted of 5 kinds of Korean alcohols. The white lotus makgeoli was my favorite. The nonalcoholic pairing is excellent. It was variety of kombuchas and you definitely don’t feel like you’re missing out. The persimmon flavor was our favorite.\n\nThe service was attentive and everyone was great.

For a place that is prix fixe, Baroo manages to make everyone feel included no matter their dietary/alcohol preferences.\n\nOf course the food was just incredible.

I got the steak as my meat of choice and it was tender and packed with flavors. They paired the entree with white wine… perfect combo for the pasta, definitely. For breakfast, I got eggs benedict.

She had the chopped Italian salad, which she described as the perfect combination of ingredients that balanced so well. I had the Chinese chicken salad, which I’m sorry to say, was kind of bland.

Staff was nice, but more Euro-attentive (not very) than American-attentive (maybe too much). Fine by me, but if you don’t like that, you’ve been warned. They had two smaller TVs over the bar, both visible from most of the place and both showing sports. Wine and cocktail selection looked strong - but I was there to eat then drive, so I didn’t sample that. Space is big and open with tables, so not really a close boothy experience for diners.

I also would have enjoyed the potatoes more if they had a crisp to them.\n\n(Note: all the pastas are cooked more on the al dente side.

We ordered the Greek Salad, Bone Marrow, Roasted Carrots, Mussels, Pork Chop, and an off menu kid’s pasta to share for 3 adults and two children. The Bone Marrow was amazing! The Greek Salad was really good too. For my beverage, I enjoyed the Brachetto, a slightly sparkling, sweet red wine. The almond cake was a great finish to the meal. My kid and I were happy and full. Our friends really enjoyed the meal too.', ""The food here is amazing, and the alcohol is quite strong. The servers are friendly and attentive. I ordered the pork tongue, which was nicely grilled, and the sauce that came with it was very delicious. For my main course, I had the half duck. The crispy skin with the duck fat was a 10/10, but the seasoning was a bit too heavy for my taste, and the meat was slightly dry.\n\nOverall, it's still a good place to try out!"", 'The food here was delicious and the service fantastic. Being that pig is the specialty we ordered all pork dishes. The pork tongue paired nicely with the bit of macaroni salad. I ordered the bone marrow. It’s tough to make bone marrow taste like anything but the sausage it was served with was great and the risotto balls delicious. My husband had the pork belly. It was sweeter than he expected but tasty.  The cherry fig old fashioned were excellent!', 'Came with my fiancée for our anniversary for an early dinner.\nI gotta say this is for now my FAVORITE restaurant, whether is the food, the service and the environment, this place is top tier.\nThe starter we had the beef tartare, this is my first time having this so I was very excited. The beef tartare was served with scented wood smoke and presented with it. Dish itself is rather rich in flavors and have multiple layers and textures. Only thing I think I can critique is the pickled fig are big compare to the paste like serving.\nThe ravioli is my favorite dish here, packed with cheese, beef and bone marrow. The flavors are rich and dense, have to drink water from finished each one because it was a lot to handle.\nPasta was packed with seafoods and squid ink pasta taste special. Only thing is the sauce is a bit too salty.\n\nOverall love love love this restaurant, we will come again!', 'Impressive mastery of flavors and ingredients and textures, beautiful presentation, comforting dishes and atmosphere. The octopus was exceptionally tender, a rare thing to find. The pork tongue was brilliantly complex and interesting - I would have never imagined pairing pork tongue with tiny dollop of pasta salad, and yet they did and it was actually delicious. Also, the tuna tartare used fresh chilled clementines as the citrus component - novel application that worked marvelously. There is a real genius crafting these dishes.']"
The Berghoff Restaurant,4.5,4391,"['Friendly staff. Tried the root beer and a few on tap beers. The sausages were soft with good texture. The creamy spinach was my favorite dish.

The root beer is delicious', ""We stumbled upon The Berghoff after  I searched for the oldest restaurant in Chicago and I was pleasantly surprised that it was a German restaurant. I come from a strong German family history so there was a lot of nostalgia in the awesome dishes we had. Our server was awesome and very helpful. I can't put into words how great this restaurant is."", 'The Berghoff had authentic German food which was good for the most part but some dishes were lacking in flavour. The restaurant itself could use a bit of a makeover but I understand they’re staying true to their roots. As a tourist to Chicago, I don’t think it was located in the best area after dark. All and all, I doubt I would return or reccomend to a friend but it wasn’t a terrible experience, good for one time.', 'Three of us dined tonight and totally enjoyed the food, service and ambiance….

Everything is worth the price and it is pricey.', 'I was shocked to wait over 20 minutes for a table on a Monday around 1 PM. I figured this place had to be really good- and it was! Outstanding items were the potatoes that came with the omelette, the Reuben sandwich, and the matzoh ball soup – although it needed to be hotter.\n\nSuper charming atmosphere. Great waiter. Prices on the high side for diner breakfast & lunch- it was close to $90 with tip for three people.\n\nThe only true negative was the coffee, which is super important for me at a breakfast place.

We sat upstairs and had Ursula as our waitress. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and offered us different options that were not on the menu.

Boka,4.7,1708,"['Great experience. Not only the food was amazing, full of surprising flavours and perfectly prepared but service with Fernando was simply perfect. Such a nice person with perfect advices on food selection and wine pairing. The music would be a bit more jazzy and subtle and the ambiance would be perfect too.\nMy only comment would be that the truffle were too subtle in the roasted chicken, the meat portion was almost too generous, I would have preferred a bit more vegetables. My expectations were a bit too high maybe, in any case it was still a marvellous experience.', 'My fourth trip to Boka was good; however, for a restaurant that earned a Michelin star the first year they were given in Chicago and maintained it ever since excellent must be the goal…\n\nFood: We started with the scallop beginning bite which was very nice - good balance of delicate flavors. Next up, our dry aged beef tartare came covered in toppings that overwhelmed the beef flavor rather than highlight it. The scallops that came after were buried in cauliflower foam - after scrapping most off the dish was great with perfectly seared scallops. For main courses we ordered the black truffle roasted chicken and the roasted beef short ribs. For both dishes the meat was okay (chicken tasted pressed, short ribs were not tender / juicy). For dessert we ended with dark chocolate - best dish of the night with amazing richness paired with pistachio and dried honey comb balanced by ginger turmeric ice cream - amazing composition!\n\nService: our primary server was disengaged. Didn’t make any mistakes but felt like he was going through the motions. Full marks for hearing our plan to share a couple dishes and bringing them out pre-split\n\nAtmosphere: nicely appointed room with tables spaced well. Quiet elegance of the decor sets a good tone for a high end experience. One noticeable detraction is the well traveled pathway from the kitchen to the bar - servers were constantly moving back and forth.\n\nSummary: overall we enjoyed our evening; however, it did not measure up to our past experiences at Boka and expectations for a Michelin starred restaurant', 'We spent the evening celebrating my wife’s birthday. The caviar and chicken liver mousse was unique with bold flavors and tasted amazing. The gnudi left us wanting an entire bowl of it. The halibut delicut and light. The main dish, the duck, was phenomenal and was quite honestly one of the best duck dishes we have ever had. The sides accompanied the duck very well. The mini desserts were fun and cute and the final touch of a birthday chocolate dessert cake was very nice. Not a knock on anything else at all but come for the duck that is the star of the show.', 'The food was incredible - I ordered the half portion of duck and I’m so glad I did. The best I’ve ever had. The aesthetics of the restaurant are on point. Great wine selection and the complementary dessert at the end really topped it off.', 'We had an amazing anniversary dinner at Boka in Chicago, and I just have to share how fantastic it was. From the moment we stepped in, the modern, stylish vibe of the place set the perfect tone for our special night.\n\nThe team at Boka really made us feel celebrated. They surprised us with a custom menu that said ""Happy Anniversary"" right on top, which was such a thoughtful touch. Almost every server who passed by took a moment to wish us a happy anniversary, making it feel like everyone in the restaurant was in on the celebration. It added a really warm and personal touch to our evening.\n\nWe were also given the choice between a booth and a table, which was a nice touch—especially since I was a bit nervous about getting a good spot. We went for the tasting menu, and wow, every dish was out of this world. The flavors were incredible, and the presentation was spot-on.\n\nWe also tried their wine tasting, and each wine was fantastic. The servers knew their stuff and took their time to explain each dish and wine pairing, which really enhanced the experience. They were attentive without hovering, making sure we had everything we needed while letting us enjoy our night.\n\nOverall, Boka exceeded our expectations in every way. It was the perfect place for our celebration, and we’ll definitely be back for another special occasion. Highly recommend!']"

We tried some drinks with very unique names related to Magic potions! The blueberry one -Blue switch was really tasty. The gnocchi I had was a special vegetarian suggestion -off the menu- by the host which really was worth the try!', 'Finally got the chance to visit this restaurant and it did not disappoint! Came here for dinner with a good friend of mine and it was a great time! Sat on the patio and it was a beautiful day. The waiter (name I forgot & forgot to get receipt. He had curly brown hair and service was phenomenal). He made sure we got the chance to look at the menu more, answered our questions, check in on us during the food, and was just so helpful! I am definitely coming back here. The food was so deliciosos and I honestly this espresso martini was better than any other places I’ve had so far!', 'Enjoyed dinner at The Dearborn after a night at the theater. Service was amazing! So friendly and we were never in need of anything. Food was delicious. My husband had the fish and chips, which was a hit. He typically never eats the slaw that is served with a dish like this, but he said this slaw was the best he’s ever had. I had the roasted chicken and it was so tender and flavorful. We will definitely come back and will recommend The Dearborn to family and friends who are in the area.', 'We were passing through and decided to stop and have a drink, it was mid afternoon, what a good surprise!\nThe drink with cucumber I had was amazing (try it) and the beer too.

I would return!', 'Excellent service, food and staff.  I Was here Saturday afternoon for a surprise birthday party.  Pizza was incredible and pasta was amazing.  Had the vodka sauce penne pasta and chicken Parmesan dish.  Staff was great.  Only thing I’d change going back is sit next to  the windows to get the views from the second floor.  Great place for dinner.', 'Loved eating at this restaurant! Food was very tasty. Plates are pretty small but they are also not too expensive so getting two per person is about right. They will bring you as much French bread as you want as well. Drink selection is a bit limited compared to most places, however they have plenty of (mostly expensive) wine to choose from. Espresso Martini was great as well.\n\nService was excellent for how busy it was when we visited. The patio is beautiful and has nice views of the surrounding skyscrapers. Be careful taking a spot out there though, and check the weather as we got rained on during our meal and had to move to an enclosed spot to avoid it. Would definitely recommend this place if you enjoy Italian food and/or wine', 'Everything was delicious the pizza is a must try!!! We sat at the bar because there was no current reservations. Only thing, I didn’t like was it was way too loud in there people were talking/yelling. Overall food is 10/10 and service as well food came out pretty fast even though it was busy. Should I mention I spent less than $50 with tips drinks and the food. Definitely worth visiting again', 'Wow, this place was hopping. They had classic cocktails and a nice beer selection. The dishes were small shareable tapa type dishes which were full of flavor. They really pack folks into this popular restaurant and as a result there is a lot of chatter but it is a lot of fun.

River Roast,4.5,3224,"[""Came here to celebrate my wife's birthday. This restaurant had the best customer service all around.  Our waiter Julio was very friendly and attentive! The food was amazing,  highly recommend the the pork belly bites and the carrot cake.  The pork porterhouse was very flavorful.  Highly recommend this place and hope you get Julio as your waiter."", 'River Roast offers delicious flavors, and the food is definitely worth trying. However, we had to wait about 1.5 hours for a whole chicken, which was a bit disappointing. The dish was abundant, perfect for two very hungry people, or even three if you order an appetizer. The prices are quite high, but that’s understandable given the location. I’m not sure if I would return; I might try another restaurant next time. We celebrated our anniversary, and the staff surprised us with a bottle of sparkling wine—a lovely gesture that we really appreciated. Overall, it’s a place you should definitely try, but be mindful of the wait times when ordering the whole chicken.', 'The roast chicken and potatoes are remarkable!! I was shocked that it was just as delicious as the reviews mentioned. My tastebuds were dancing! It easily shareable but I had mine all to myself. You will not regret ordering it.', 'This is a late review ( we visited place a month ago). It was extremely hot day, but we wanted to be sited outside, where we got a table (regretted after that :-D ). It was around noon, and no waiting time. Service was good, fast.\n\nWe ordered sandwiches and hamburgers. Food was average, absolutely nothing to be trilled about. We felt rushed the whole time. I understand them, but also we met with friends that we haven’t seen for a long time, so, that left some kind of bad impression. On top of that, baser took my friend’s french fries while he was still eating, without even asking him - are you done. Since he was eating, he couldn’t stop him. The situation was awkward. When the waitress came, we explained her the situation, she apologised and offer to bring another portion of French fries, but my friend said it is ok because he didn’t want to make a scene.\n\nAll in all, I didn’t have the best experience here. Place is nice, service is fast, but this is typical tourist place. I wouldn’t recommend this for seeing your friends that you haven’t seen in a long time.', ""I recently had the pleasure of dining at River Roast in Chicago, and I must say, the experience was exceptional from start to finish. The service was top-notch, with the staff going above and beyond to ensure our meal was perfect. They were attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable, adding a personal touch that made the evening even more enjoyable.\n\nOne of the highlights of the meal was the rabbit waffle. It was a unique and delicious dish that combined the savory flavors of perfectly fried rabbit with the sweetness of a crispy waffle. The presentation was beautiful, and each bite was a delightful blend of textures and flavors.\n\nTo top it all off, the view from the restaurant was stunning. Overlooking the Chicago River, it provided the perfect backdrop for a memorable dining experience. Whether you're looking for a romantic dinner spot or just a great place to enjoy some incredible food with friends, River Roast is a must-visit in Chicago.""]"
avec Restaurant,4.6,2096,"['One word to describe this place - Phenomenal! Ambiance, service and food were fantastic.

I’m pescatarian, and there’s not too many choices for me, but what I do try is pretty stellar. The tomato’s are AMAZING.\n\nService: The staff is always super nice and friendly. They’ll really help with the menu choices.\n\nSeating: the outdoor patio is my favorite place to sit. The inside gets a little loud, but still a fun ambiance.\n\nOverall: 9/10 :)', 'Came here for our first wedding anniversary (and first time in) we were asked when making the reservation if it was a special occasion, but we were never asked about it or congratulated or anything during our visit which was a tad disappointing. Why ask about it when booking if it clearly does not matter.\n\nThe food was great! Absolutely loved the calamari! Loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. Our plates were cleared and reset before our large plates arrived and we were always good on drinks. Our service was great, server was just okay. Loved our desserts as well!', ""I had a great first visit to this place and would return if I lived in Chicago. It's a small place, but they have a couple of outdoor tables. The amiable staff ensures you have the best experience during your visit.\n\nTheir menu isn't extensive, but that's actually appreciated as it can be overwhelming to decide what to eat. The kitchen specializes in what they offer, and you can taste the quality and flavors in every bite. While the dishes aren't overly complex, the flavors and quality of the ingredients definitely shine through."", 'I had heard so many good things about this place!! And it totally lived up to the hype. The restaurant is striking in appearance with a long rectangular and narrow shape with a long bar on one side and row of tables on the other.\n\nFor two people, they recommended 2 small dishes and 1 large dish. Sontra took our order and was so sweet and helpful, she could tell we wanted to try more things and so asked for 1/2 orders of certain dishes so we could have more!\n\nThe medjool dates were a standout with a beautiful tomato sauce, and nice rich chorizo inside. This is a must if you come here.\n\nThe kale hummus was so unique and full of amazing textures, also a must!!! It was covered in crispy crunchy fried shallots, and the cubes of cheese on top were soft and were not too tangy (they were a perfect complement). The pita and bread were fantastic for soaking up all the extra sauce.\n\nThe cabbage came with a beautiful dill sauce, it could have been softer or more cooked through but the flavor was delicious.\n\nThe pork shoulder was unreal, super soft and moist, falling apart. The saffron orzo was such a beautiful flavor I could not get enough of, and with the greens on top added that freshness and lightness to the dish. Flavors went amazing together. The clams were a really nice addition that seemed natural paired with it.\n\nWe were too full for dessert and couldn’t finish everything! So Sontra boxed it up for us and even included two small bites of brownie as a treat. We were so thankful!\n\nThe other patrons were raving about the food and it was bustling!! I would recommend this spot to a group of 6 to be able to sample more dishes and not get too full. Additionally, the table seating was more amenable to larger groups. The bar makes sense for 2 people so good spot for dates as well. Somewhat tight quarters inside and you do have to squeeze in the walkway so maybe not ideal for anyone claustrophobic or with mobility issues!\n\nAll in all I will be recommending the place to as many people as possible, fabulous!']"

I’ll most definitely will be back.', 'Spectacular.\n\nOh, you want more??!\n\nWell, for starters, I love that you have to be deliberate about heading to Aba as the restaurant is on the third floor. And once the elevator door opens, your senses are met with an opulence familiar with the west loop. Dining indoors or out, you will enjoy a comfortable yet luxurious experience. Small plates means more flavors and I say, take a deep dive. We had 8-10 and each one uniquely delicious. Must have: whipped feta, tuna/watermelon, lamb kabobs and chicken kabob, and any hummus.\nSo much food, so little time. Enjoy 😉', 'We booked Aba while visiting Chicago for the first time. What an amazing place! Aba is a Mediterranean Tapas place that has indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is rooftop seating with a view of the city. I love tapas places and visit them frequently. Aba is simply has the best tapas I have ever had anywhere! Everything was delicious but the winners were the short rib hummus, and the watermelon tuna. The hummus was so good I asked for extra bread to finish it. The service was impeccable as well. I hope to be back at some point when back in Chicago!', 'Aba has some of the best ""dips"" I\'ve had - the whipped feta and spicy hummus are MUST orders, but honestly, any of the hummus dishes would\'ve been excellent. It paired really well with the two types of in house pita bread they offered, and we ended up eating a lot of bread and dips.\n\nWe also got a round of cocktails - they were well made and a good value.\n\nThe short rib shakshuka, while good, is not something I\'d order again, it felt a little heavy to me. The khachapuri was really tasty and came with two dips - the pesto and tzatziki, which once again elevated the dish.\n\nOverall, this was a fantastic meal and worth the hype - you should absolutely go here for brunch if you\'re in West Loop.']"

What kept me coming back was Liam, the bartender who is so fun and personable. He also makes a mean espresso martini which I ordered in abundance. I would come back time and time again to hang out with him and enjoy the ambiance and the overpriced salad.\n\nIf you’re in the area for a theatre show I would say this is definitely a pre show option. They close mad early so it is ONLY a pre show option.\n\nOverall, this wasn’t a bad meal option, especially considering the convenience of staying in the connecting hotel.\n\nOh, also, I ordered breakfast here once; the avocado toast which was very delicious. I would order that TIME AND TIME AGAIN!', 'We had an early dinner at 312 Chicago before our theatre show. The service was impeccable - very friendly and professional. The food is Italian food at its best. The octopus antipasti was well liked, though our favorite was the pesto pasta with added salmon. It was fresh and a perfect balance of pesto, cheese and cream. I also had an espresso martini which was nice. One in our party had the burger and it was a large portion and looked great.', 'Stopped by before seeing a show, very impressed! We sat at the bar and were treated to exceptional cocktails and even better service!

I don’t understand the American obsession with them, certainly don’t belong in a British roast) covered half the plate. The mash potatoes were dry as a bone, not helped by the dribble of gravy. The meat (allegedly beef) was grey and rubbery.\n\nIt was like a time warp back to the worst days of school dinners. It made a Spoons roast look like fine dining.', 'My family stopped by for lunch while visiting Chicago on vacation. The service was great and the food was delicious. We shared the fried pickle chips. I had the steak and mushroom pot pie and the pie dough was very flaky and tender. The pie part was very savory and hot. This pub is sure worth a repeat visit when in town.', 'In town for a weekend wedding and took a short walk from the hotel to find a quick bite to eat during happy hour. We found Elephant & Castle and it had a nice selection of happy hour choices along with pot pies, a personal favorite.

The Chicago Firehouse Restaurant,4.5,1690,"['We visited this place on a whim on Sweetest Day. We had to pivot from our original plan, called at the last minute and was able to take the 9:15p slot. We had to wait for our table so we ordered drinks at the bar. My mule was good and my date enjoyed her wine. For my entree, I ordered the Roasted chicken served of spinach and mash potatoes. The chicken could have used more seasoning, but overall it was good. My dates entree was the Spicy Chicken sandwich, she said it was good, but it really wasn’t spicy. The sides dishes we ordered are Creamed Spinach and Mac & cheese. We disliked both dishes. The Mac & Cheese needs way more cheese. I received complimentary dessert because we were there celebrating my birthday too. The carrot cake was 🔥🔥🔥 and the vanilla bean ice cream was good too.', ""service was absolutely amazing and our waiter was super patient, explained everything, made great recommendations, and consistently checked up on us throughout the night. the food was amazing and was so delicious. definitely try the fried calamari, the sauce is so amazing and it was cooked to perfection. the price was just right and the portions were so big. the vibe is also so amazing, the interior is decorated nicely, it's quiet, and there is so much natural light."", 'Great tasting food. Awesome atmosphere and wonderful service. Delmonico steak cooked to perfection. Firecracker shrimp has right amount of sweet and spice. Would highly recommend for dinner or happy hour.', ""Situated within a beautifully restored old firehouse, The Chicago Firehouse Restaurant offers a dining experience that is nothing short of extraordinary. The moment you step through its grand doors, you're greeted with an ambiance that seamlessly blends historic charm with modern elegance. The high ceilings, original firehouse fixtures, and vintage fire poles create a unique and welcoming atmosphere. The dim lighting, combined with rich wooden accents and plush seating, sets the stage for an evening of refined indulgence. As you settle into your seat, the aroma of sizzling gourmet creations fills the air, instantly heightening your anticipation. The smell of freshly baked bread mingles with the tantalizing scent of seared meats and aromatic spices, creating a sensory prelude to the culinary delights that await. I opted for the Burger 104, a masterpiece that exemplifies the restaurant’s dedication to quality and flavor. This burger features two succulent Angus beef patties that are perfectly cooked to a juicy, flavorful perfection. Each bite of the beef is tender and rich, with a satisfying char that speaks to expert grilling techniques. The addition of Benton’s bacon adds a smoky, savory crunch that complements the meat beautifully. Melted American cheese oozes over the patties, providing a creamy, slightly tangy contrast to the robust flavors of the beef and bacon. The B&B pickles add a touch of acidity and crunch, balancing the richness of the other ingredients. Everything is encased in a soft, yet sturdy pretzel bun, whose slight sweetness and hint of saltiness round out the flavor profile of the burger. Accompanying the Burger 104 are perfectly crisp French fries. Golden and seasoned just right, they provide a delightful contrast to the hearty burger, adding a satisfying crunch and a touch of comfort to the meal. Dining at The Chicago Firehouse Restaurant is an experience that transcends the ordinary. From its historic and chic setting to the meticulous attention to detail in its cuisine, every aspect of this restaurant exudes excellence. Whether you're there for a special occasion or just to enjoy a remarkable meal, The Chicago Firehouse Restaurant promises a memorable dining adventure that tantalizes all your senses."", 'Best wedding I could have asked for.

Topolobampo,4.5,682,"['This restaurant was the meal we were most looking forward to in Chicago, but it turned out to be the most shocking one. If you are unfamiliar with Mexican culture and are thinking about trying something new, think twice!\n\nEvery dish was extremely salty, and the tortillas had a strong fermented taste. One of the dishes included beef bone marrow, which was incredibly greasy and nauseating. The dessert, a pineapple and apple wrap, had such intense spices that it destroyed my sanity.\n\nThe five of us spent nearly $2,000, which I personally think was not worth it given the quality and ingredients of the food. The only redeeming feature was the upgraded wine list, which was quite good.', 'I dined here as a solo diner while in town for work and had an amazing meal. The Mexico City taco tour was a blast and a fabulous tribute. To the reviewers who didn’t enjoy their meals, I have no idea what happened because mine was amazing from beginning to end.', ""Starting with the good - the food was tasty and well executed. While some dishes were lacking a bit in balance for my pallette, I recognize that these are takes on traditional dishes, that aren't always balanced, and is therefore meant to be experienced this way.\nThe only nit I have is for the dish with the truffle - the poblano crema has a very dominant flavor that drowns out any hint of truffle. Either add way more truffle or remove it, as it feels out of place.\n\nFor the bad - ambiance was just uncomfortable. The music was waaaaay too loud, to the point where our servers was explaining a dish and made a comment on how loud it is (and it still wasn't turned down). This was to the point of discomfort and made the relatively long waits between dishes feel even longer. It was a 2.5 hour uncomfortable experience and despite the food being great, we couldn't wait to leave.\nTo add to that, the couch/seat I was on was uncomfortable and the AC was running a bit too cold. This genuinely is disappointing because it for sure soured the experience for us.\n\nFinally, service was mediocre. While our table was always expediently cleaned, but water wasn't refilled frequently, and our server forgot when that we noted at the very beginning that we won't be having alcohol and proceeded to offer the pairings some 10 minutes later. Combined with the long waits and the occasional struggle to recall dish ingredients, it did not help the issues I listed above.\n\nAll in all, the food is well worth the money, but the overall experience makes it a place I can't recommend and won't go back to.\nHopefully it was just an off night."", 'Had a private party at the library room at Topolobampo. Very tasty food in a nice ambience. There is a nice mirror that shows the food being prepared. And it is apparently the largest library of Mexican cookbooks in the country. Food was tasty though portion size was a touch small. Staff is friendly and location is very central. Happy to return.', ""We went here for a pre-columbian tasting menu, featuring ingredients from Central America prior to the Spanish colonial period. The food offered unusual tastes that you probably have not encountered. The flavors are generally creamy but light with a hint of spiciness. The service was quite good, though a little slow. The ambience inside the Topolobampo area (it's connected to its cousin Mexican restaurant) is warming and comforting, though a little small. Given the price, it's worth a try to get an experience of new flavors. Note that they change the menu quite often, so it's worth checking with the restaurant before committing to the reservation and deposit.""]"

The Eggs Benedict came with waffles and pulled pork, and the eggs were great. We really enjoyed the Puerco Picante Skillet - it had great spiciness levels. For his birthday, we chose a pancake as a side, which turned out to be one of the best birthday cakes ever! It was a good size, and he devoured it quickly. Both dishes left us with great leftovers for the next day.\n\nOne thing to note is the parking situation. Finding parking was a bit challenging. There's an indoor parking lot where parking is free for up to two hours (possibly three hours) with a receipt from Mariano's - but you'll need to check.

We ordered a Pizza with truffle and arugula. On our second visit, we ordered bruschetta and spaghetti with spicy tomato sauce. We asked for arrabbiata sauce but they did not have vegetarian sauce. So they made spicy tomato sauce for us. It was indeed spicy and very tasty. The food here took us back to the time when we had Italian food in Rome and Florence.', 'I have been to this restaurant for a couple times now. They offer a wide variety of food to choose from. And the flavor is very authentic. One dish I would recommend is a vegan dish made of eggplant. I am a meat lover but love that dish surprisingly.', 'Amazing food! Huge portions. We had to bring half of it with us. Very tasty and true Italian dishes. Very friendly and quite fast. We will visit again soon.', 'Amazing Italian food! I ordered some grilled seafood and Spaghetti Neri. The sauce for the Grigliata Mista was delicious, and the portion was huge for an appetizer. The spaghetti was creamy with a perfect blend of seafood! The restaurant was very busy, and we were seated at the bar, so there was always someone passing behind us. The bartender was gone half of the time, which made it a bit difficult to get timely service.\n\nBut overall, their food is a must-try! One of the best Italian restaurants I’ve ever been to.']"
Provare Chicago,4.6,1141,"['Love everything about the ambiance and atmosphere! Music was definitely a vibe! Portion sizes were definitely filling.

My husband had medium cooked lamb chops very delicious and I had salmon Alfredo very delicious ! I am drinking Randolph very good.', 'Ordered takeout. The meal did not disappoint. The food came hot and ready quick and was so good. I ordered the shrimp and crawfish spinach artichoke dip and the spicy seafood trio. It gave the option to have the spices on the side which I did. The seafood tasted so fresh and I’m not a big spice person so I liked it w/o it.', 'I would recommend this place 1,000 times over again! My husband and I went on a date night from Missouri just to eat there and it was AMAZING! One of the best restaurants we have ever been to. We will definitely be going back as many times as possible.

Don’t forget to make your reservations and visit soon!', 'Ordered my dinner to go. I I ordered the seafood trio pasta with lamb chops on the the side. Charged for the lamb chops, did not have them with my order. They were sure to take their 20% though. I’ll be disputing. Overall nice atmosphere and staff.', ""Came to Chicago for a concert and Provare was on my list of restaurants to try. To start, the staff was amazing. Everyone was nice and upbeat. When I came in we were offered complimentary shots that was cute and good. We started off having spinach artichoke dip,and garlic bread. The dip was so creamy and tasty and the bread was oozing butter so nice and soft. I then had the seafood trio and paired it with a lamb chop, which was nice, tender, and well seasoned! Perfect deliciousness match!! To end it of course we had to get the butter cake. It was tasty and moist!! This restaurant was definitely Fire  and A vibe, I can't wait to come back!!!""]"
Sepia,4.6,1307,"[""We waited at the bar for our table, but were guided shortly after. 4-course prix fix with lots of great choices that didn't disappoint. All the dishes were well presented and tasted amazing. Wine list is extensive and reflect an adequate price point based on the restaurant standards. Service was very attentive and extremely gracious. A great experience and one of the finer meal we had while visiting Chicago."", 'Food 2/5 stars - could be better. Started off strong with the first dish (king crab) and ended poorly with the short rib and cloud cake (both of which seemed unbalanced flavour wise). None of the food was mouth watering however and nothing I would try again.\n\nService 2/5 - it was definitely a bit awkward with the servers constantly watching you as you eat. We ordered super quick and the server seemed shocked at that, especially because we didn’t order drinks beforehand. Felt a little like if you didn’t spend as much money as possible you were looked down upon.\n\nAtmosphere 2/5 - cute atmosphere inside but the seating was not ideal. The tables were really low to the ground and the chairs were really high. Not ideal for someone who is on the taller side.\n\nOverall, though I appreciate a good quality tasting meal, it didn’t hit the spot for me in a way that justified the huge price.', 'Absolutely incredible dining experience.  There is a reason this place has a Michelin star: the menu offers a true tour for the senses, with courses as aesthetically pleasing as they are delicious, and flavors as novel as they are interesting. The wine menu is also excellent, and the service on par with what you would expect at such a place.\n\nThe environment is upscale but not standoffish, classy yet approachable. The kind of place that would serve some of the best dishes in town without requiring a dinner jacket. Perfect for a date, dinner with a client, or an upscale dinner with friends. It’s not cheap, but you pay for what you get, and I left feeling like the experience was well worth the price.\n\nDo yourself a favor and treat yourself to Sepia the first chance you get.', ""Went there to celebrate our anniversary night. The food was amazing, and the wine pairing was excellent. My husband loved the Pavlova dessert – one of the best he's ever had. I enjoyed every dish; the flavors were delicate and well-balanced. We were very pleased to get a delicious compliment as well to celebrate our anniversary.\n\nHowever, I'm giving 3 stars for the service because our table could have been kept a bit cleaner, and the seating experience fell short. In a Michelin-starred restaurant, I expect more courtesy with seating arrangements. Unlike my husband, I wasn’t offered any assistance when being seated.\n\nDespite that I’d recommend the restaurant, as food and wine pairing was very good."", ""Oh my! We've eaten at several Michelin starred restaurants around the world. Dare I say it, this was one of our best experiences. As a picky eater, I'm especially appreciative of a carefully curated menu with options. Own top of that, service was stellar. Being seated in a private section of the restaurant made the celebration dinner even more special. The staff was attentive, but not overbearing.\n\nThe complimentary prosciutto starter foretold a divine dinner to come. Each dish was phenomenal. I could easily eaten 10 of the scallops, and briefly contemplated requesting another order. The subtlety spiced English pee puree perfectly complemented the sweet and succulent scallops. Sepia is a perfect date night for any occasion. Definitely looking forward to going back the next time we're in town.""]"
Alla Vita,4.8,2769,"['This place is SO GOOD! The pasta is silky, esp the tagliatelle is perfect, the appetizers delicious, and the chicken parm a solid classic.

And to celebrate our friend they gave us a little dessert!', ""Excellent food with top quality service! Not enough reviews are raving about the pizzas but we ordered both the Fennel Sausage pizza (pink sauce base with sausage and pesto on top) and the Prosciutto Pizza. And both were delicious (easy 5/5s) as the flavors of the meats and toppings complimented the sauces and the pizza base very well. The pizza crust itself was the perfect mix of crunchy yet light and chewy.\n\nI highly recommend looking at the pizzas if you are considering one, as the ones we ordered were delicious and I'm sure all of them are incredible! The Rigatoni Alla Vodka was pretty good (4/5) but the standouts of our night were definitely the pizzas.\n\nOverall, this restaurant was an extreme hit and I would definitely come back another time!"", 'The food, service and ambiance were fantastic. Our waitress was amazing and so helpful with suggestions. The staff was very attentive to refill our glasses and with our dishes. The food was spectacular and just an overall beautiful restaurant. No complaints it was a perfect place to have dinner. Octopus, kale salad,  meat balls, tagliatelle, budino and gelato were all delicious', ""I had some of the best Italian food here! The squid ink chitarra pasta was exceptional—absolutely delicious, with every bite savored. The tiramisu was, without a doubt, the best I've ever tasted. Highly recommend this restaurant. The ambience is lovely, especially in the evening."", 'We made a reservation a few days in advance and had very prompt service once getting to the restaurant. The waitress was very informative on all questions that we had. As for orders, we ordered a rigatoni and margarita pizza. The rigatoni fell flat on the flavor pallet for me, but the margarita pizza was phenomenal. We highly recommend getting the appetizer of house bread for any meal, regardless of entrée!!']"

Their desserts were sweet, especially the Basque cheesecake.\n\nI would definitely recommend visiting this place for dates and events.', 'Roister certainly has a unique vibe to it that’s both modern and rustic at the same time. The food was delicious and the staff brought out the plates for 2 people per dish as we had a big group. I’d say the vegetable dishes stood out the most to me, especially the cauliflower and broccoli. I’d recommend Rositer hands down and looking forward to coming back again. They have a few cocktail bars nearby to cap off your dinner.', 'Generally, the food is very good. The only downside is that it’s not a great spot for vegetarians given that most of the vegetarian options are vegetable dishes. I would think that Grant and his team could come up with some new ideas that are appealing to vegetarians that aren’t a vegetable with delicious sauces. Either way, it’s a good dining experience (and you’ll be paying Fulton Market pricing here).', ""Went here for my birthday. Had seats at the hearth, turns out that's basically a bar overlooking the kitchen. So much to see and watch. The cooking stuff is extremely busy but we had a chance to chat and learn about some of the different stations. Drinks are delicious and unique. We had the smoked clams and oysters. The oysters were uniquely tasty. Then we had the cauliflower cheese fry bread dish which did not disappoint. Finally we had the Pastrami and seafood bucatini. Absolutely out of this world. Melts in your mouth delicious. Finally we shared the banana dessert which was, after everything being so stellar, fine. Cannot wait to go back to try the duck and the chicken"", ""On our trip from New York to Chicago, we decided to visit this restaurant based on a friend's suggestion. We appreciated the open kitchen concept, and the ambiance was pleasant, although the music didn't quite fit the atmosphere. Our server provided excellent service, no complaints there. However, we found the food to be somewhat lacking. While it was good, it didn't quite live up to the hype we had anticipated. Perhaps our expectations were too high. Although the Fried Chicken, touted as the specialty, was fairly ordinary, we were pleasantly surprised by the Agnolotti, which was packed with flavor. Another standout was the pear salad, which we thoroughly enjoyed. Overall, it was a decent experience, and we would still recommend it.""]"
Virtue Restaurant,4.6,1823,"['We had the pleasure of having Joe as our server. The atmosphere, the vibes, the FOOD, I literally walked in hungry and left full and happy. The flavors the mixtures and textures were quite literally so amazing. Joe was so helpful with giving us full recommendations and knew the menu so thoroughly to help me with my dairy restrictions. We got an amazing squash and apple dish with coconut and puffed rice, the GUMBO (literally to die for the spices and flavor was actually sublime), the half chicken with candied yams and jus, the softest pull apart ribs with amazing mashed potatoes and collard greens paired perfectly with the smoked turkey. I literally can’t say enough I absolutely loved this amazing place. We WILL be back again thank you so much for existing.', 'Easily in the top 5 best meals I’ve had in my life. Very clear that whoever made the food tonight has a true and rare gift.\n\nChicken gizzards were tender, and fried perfectly in that way where despite being deep fried feels airily light. Little bits of celery punctuated a sauce that was a masterful balance, part acid and part unctuous richness.\n\nThe short ribs stole my heart. Hit all the right notes. Carmelized outside, tender inside. Paired so well with the potatoes and creamed spinach. The texture of the potatoes was delightful. A little creamy and a little chunky.\n\nI had sweet pie for dessert because a meal that good deserves an encore. Really tasty stuff, not too sweet.\n\nI’m only in town visiting, but this is the kind of meal that’s worth hopping on a plane for.

Whatever Rog said came true like a Genie, plus, my husband and I felt like royalty due to the service of Rog! The drink recommendation was perfect, I ordered the Put the Lime in the Kiwi 🥝 cocktail. Plus, Rog had a superior knowledge of absolutely everything and then some! The gumbo is now at the top of my list, right up there with my visits to New Orleans and my Cousin's! My husband had the half chicken, so spicy good, and I ordered the delicious blackened catfish. I especially loved both kinds of carrots, the barbecue and the puree. The tasty 7-Up cake dessert, to quote Rog, is reminiscent of one from the back of a Southern church! The atmosphere had diversity, couples, friends, etc., all cultures. Great music. 🎵 I will definitely return!""]"
Oriole,4.8,531,"[""Oriole exceeded our expectations, which was no easy task because our expectations were high.

Turns out, I needn't have been; once the experience began, time was irrelevant.\n\nFrom the moment we entered the reception area until we departed, the service team at Oriole treated us like visiting royalty. Don't mistake that, though, for stuffy ambiance; service was both sophisticated and approachable. Every person we encountered was friendly, informative and engaging. This staff clearly prioritizes connection with their guests. I loved hearing stories about the winemakers featured in the beverage pairing.\n\nOh, and the food. The food is beyond compare. If you appreciate depth of flavor, creative combinations and exquisite plating, you will be a fan of each course Oriole crafts.\n\nTruly, dining at Oriole is better classified as an experience than a meal.

I stand by both of those descriptors.\n\nIf ever I have an opportunity to dine here again, I will not hesitate to book."", 'Fantastic food and even better service.

We found the food to be overall quite bland.\n\nThere were some adventurous attempts.\n\nThe plating usually looked decent, and the courses always sounded like they could be hits.\n\nHowever the most important thing, the taste of the food, consistently fell short (aside from one dish).\n\nFor the price, I definitely wouldn’t recommend it and there are certainly better options for Michelin stars around.', 'Mind blowing food, minute attention to service, friendly, warm staff, a calm, happy kitchen.

This visit was our first time for all in my party, and all were well satisfied.', 'This place was recommended to me since I eat a vegetarian diet. I’m always into trying new veggie places to see how they do things and I can’t wait to go back! I had the Truffle Mushroom Lentil Loaf with green beans and potatoes - it’s exactly what you would think. Though more lentil filled flavor than I would have liked. But the S’mores Brownie Sundae 🔥🔥 get it, but share it. It’s a lot of rich deliciousness!', 'Best vegan food I’ve ever had, hands down. Often a wait and once seated, we had to frequently ask the server to order and remind them of drinks we were waiting on. Still, best vegan food.\n\nHuge portions. My go-to order is the Reuben sandwich. Sadly, no beers on tap, but several can-options available and reasonably priced mixed drinks.', 'Everything is vegan by default but you can add real cheese if you wish.\n\nOverall: Average. Nothing I ordered blew my mind but again, this is a Diner so you take what you can.\n\nSpicy chicken quesadilla (Appetizer): big portion and it had a good amount of internal fillings. Fillings included bell peppers, onions, chicken and cheese. I wish they had more cheese in the quesadilla itself because it felt as though Phil overwhelmed the entire dish.\n\nTaco salad (Salad): Nothing to write home about. The flavors you would find in a traditional taco salad or nowhere to be found in this one. It felt as though they just took the various ingredients listed on the menu and just threw everything together without really considering additional spices or appropriate ratios of each item.\n\nLavender Gimlet (Signature Drink): if you like gin, I think this would be a really great drink choice for you because the gin flavor definitely stand out as well as the lavender as well.\n\nStaff: Overall good.\n\nADA: there are steps that lead up to the restaurant so it would be quite difficult for someone with a wheelchair to get into here and I don’t believe the doors are wide enough for wheelchair users.', 'The food was great, the portions are decent-sized and tasted great!

LH Rooftop,4.2,3227,"['We recently visited this venue after hearing great things on social media, particularly about the stunning river views. There’s no denying that the scenery here is absolutely breathtaking, and it’s clear this place has a lot of potential. However, our experience was a bit of a mixed bag.\n\nWhile we understand that this is a popular spot, we weren’t aware that reservations were booked out weeks in advance. Unfortunately, this left us without seating, which was a bit disappointing as we had been looking forward to enjoying a few drinks while taking in the view. It would be fantastic if they could create a small section for walk-in guests to relax, even if just for a drink or two. This would make the experience much more accessible for those who come across the venue spontaneously, as we did.\n\nThe environment is certainly geared towards families, and the reserved seating areas reflect that. While this is great for those who plan ahead, it does limit options for walk-ins who may also want to spend time and money here.\n\nA small note on the outdoor experience: while it’s understandable that nature is unpredictable, the number of bees around was quite overwhelming, especially when you’re just trying to enjoy a drink. A bit more attention to this could make a big difference, especially for guests like myself who are allergic to bees.\n\nOverall, this place is still at the top of our recommendation list for the views alone, but we hope to see a few tweaks in the future to make it even more enjoyable for all types of visitors.

We got the gnocchi straight, no protein, but our server said to add protein, and it would be a sharable. There were like 12 gnocchi in the bowl. It was good though, but graciously declined the protein.\nThe vodka sauce rigatoni, yes It was good.  Overall, food was a bit over priced, server was not worth a 20% for a tip for a real nice place..and the machine he had with our credit card was already showing 30% tip.

We have visited a Smith before in New York City, and we are glad that the Chicago location carries forward the same quality and experience.\nBoth our dishes were very good. The goat cheese omelette is fluffy and smooth. It does have a lot of spinach, so be prepared for that. The Vanilla Bean French Toast should probably be illegal, it is too good. Every single bite is better than the last, and you can't stop eating until the plate is clean. The side of bacon is very good but a bit pricey.\nOne awesome note is that for brunch, certain menu items get you a free brunch cocktail. We chose mimosas but there are other options available. This is a nice little perk that makes the value of the meal much more attractive.\nWe visited right at open and the service was very efficient and pleasant.

Waiting time for your food (from order to eat) was less than 20 minutes.\nI ordered an all-American burger for $18.\nEverything inside was tasty, except buns.', 'Excellent meal. My ribeye was cooked perfectly and so flavorful. The charred broccoli is a hidden gem on the menu. The artichoke spinach dip and chips was a tasty appetizer. I also enjoyed the short rib rigatoni, but my wife only thought it was okay. That one has a unique taste that might not be for all. Would definitely visit again.', 'Remington’s is perfectly located across the street from the giant bean and Millennium Park. I loved the vibe of the restaurant decor. Our waitress was so friendly and made great recommendations. Our only regret was that we wanted to try dessert, but we were so full we couldn’t manage it. I highly recommend the Lobster Deviled Eggs as an appetizer. Great experience overall!']"
Chicago Cut Steakhouse,4.4,2951,"['Loved bringing my 12 yr old son for his birthday. Easy to find, valet parking right out front, and table was ready as soon as we arrived. Reservation strongly encouraged. We came on a Friday evening and it was at capacity. We sat outside to enjoy the view and even though the day was somewhat windy, they do have heaters out. Our waiter Patrick was amazing. He took the time to educate my son on non-alcoholic mock tails, steak cuts and made the perfect food recommendations. Our favorite was the appetizer Lobstercargot. Dessert is complementary for special occasions. My son opted for the chocolate cake.

The host even offered to take my glass of wine outside for me, which was a gesture that truly impressed me.\n\nEvery steak cut offered here is just AMAZING and bursting with flavor. I have to say, this place serves the best steak in Chicago. I have never had any complaints about anything on the menu; everything is consistently delicious.

I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an exceptional fine dining experience in the Windy City.', 'Absolutely fantastic food, service and atmosphere.  If you are looking to have a key dinner with a business partner or a date night where you want to impress Chicago Cut should make your list.  Bring your wallet because things this good have prices that reflect the value.  Definitely worth it.  We made it here twice while in Chicago for a week!', ""No misunderstanding but it's a good restaurant but I feel in a rush. The waitresses was pushing me and my wife to order and eat really fast.

We ordered Bone in filet and NY dry cut. The taste & quality was fantastic. I also ordered a cheesy potato side which was top notch. All in all, I enjoyed the whole experience and definitely go back when in Chicago again.', 'The steaks were cooked to perfection—juicy, flavorful, and exactly how I ordered them. The service was equally impressive, with friendly and attentive staff who made sure everything was just right.', 'I’m normally a huge fan of the Capital Grille. And I was excited for their Wagyu burger. However, when I ordered a medium rare temperature, it was undercooked and barely warm to the touch in the center with visible raw meat. I’m not a professional cook, but I know the center should be somewhere in the low 130s F for medium rare. Not the best for a steakhouse. Everything else was good, including the soup and french fries. The staff were very nice.', 'One of the best restaurants in Chicago! Our server David went above and beyond! He was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, and had excellent suggestions for us. He kept us laughing the entire meal! The manager Adam stopped by to ensure everything was delicious - which it was! His friendliness and attention to detail did not go unnoticed. The entire meal was incredible, and the service (from chef, to management, to servers) was top notch. Thank you to David, Edgar, Adam and Luis for making it such a memorable experience! We will certainly be back.', 'Mike is 5 stars... he is a great addition to the capital grille. He embodies what service is as service does.

So good, I bought a couple bags to bring home from their store in the front.', ""We had a party of 10 and our waiter, Austin, did an OUTSTANDING job by himself!

State of Grace,4.7,1659,"['Long time, all time favorite Houston restaurant of mine. From the art nouveau branding and decor to the one of a kind oyster room adorning the front of the establishment you can’t help but be enamored when you first walk in. Chef Ford Fry consistently delivers a quality menu with thoughtful preparation and execution. If there’s a restaurant that can scream ‘River Oaks’ without coming across as pretentious then this is it. Excellent wine selection, consistently fantastic food whether you’re here for brunch, lunch or dinner, you can’t go wrong. Personal favorites are the crab hush puppies, the raw oyster selection and the wild boar jowl. Also don’t miss out on the Felix enchilada, it’s an unsuspecting show stopper.', 'The hospitality was great from the moment we walked in the door. The weight staff and food was also good. we got the seafood platter and everything tasted fresh. The chocolate pecan dessert was more than we had hoped for! One downside is that it only has limited bathrooms (I think 3-4) and they are not gender assigned so the ladies have to have to hover over the urine that the men couldn’t seem to make inside the toilet because they forgot to lift the seat up. Men, do better.', 'I decided to wipe away the Hurricane Beryl blues with an early dinner at”State of Grace”.\nFrom the minute I arrived and handed my keys to valet to the minute I got back into my car - everything was of the highest quality & service!🏆 From the initial welcome greeting to the precise timing in approaching my table, my server Dominic was a top-notch professional. He assisted with all questions, explain the menu thoroughly, & periodically checked on me to be sure that everything that was placed in front of me was nothing short of perfect! I had the 8oz Filet Mignon with black rice that packed an exhilarating taste!!! I cannot pile the right chose of words to the deliciousness of my food.

If you get the opportunity, please take a moment to make a reservation and experience how magnificent this place is. 🍸\nVisit “State of Grace” and you will be eating happy. 🤍', 'State of Grace 2.0 is a HIT.  My only question is ""How do you choose!?!?!"" because everything is immaculate.  From the first drop of the bread with the Altima Caviar Amber Oscietra service add-on, I was in heaven.  We ordered the steak tartare - FIRE, the crudo, scallops & steak.  Best martini in town - hand shaken at your table.  I cannot rave enough about the staff, their new olive green uniforms and attention to detail regarding service.  Table side is tough to pull off and they do it with ease.  I am obsessed and want more.', 'Excellent service, great menu, loved the way the waitress explained the menu. Creamy mashed potato was out of the world along with steak.

It came with 4 pieces of shrimp tossed in a lightly sweetened sauce and some corn.  We both ordered red snapper fish and grits meals (11am).  The fish was fried crispy and seasoned perfectly. The grits were creamy and good. I had chocolate mousse cake. The size was a little disappointing and the flavor was a little odd.\n\nOverall, it was a delicious and worth the visit especially for a date or special occasion."", 'WOW!  This experience was overwhelmingly positive. From the greeters, our amazingly beautiful and decorated private room at the Chef’s Table, the food and the service, we were  BEYOND impressed. I was there celebrating my birthday with a party of about 15 and it was definitely a night to remember. The food was absolutely delicious with HUGE portions.

I had to share my experience with my husband and he is now planning a date night so he can see for himself, lol.', ""Always a great time!! The seafood dip is my favorite appetizer!! I got the fried red snapper and it was amazing!! The cream corn and mash potatoes were top tier!! But let me not forget to mention my favorite waiter Kim!! She's so sweet!! Beautiful inside and out!! She has great suggestions if you've  never been here before!!"", ""Overall, the food was great! Lots of bold tasting dishes and fun, flavorful drinks. They serve you complimentary champagne while you wait to be seated, which I thought was a nice touch. The sides were all amazing! Don't get the oysters as they are NOT served on ice and the cocktail sauce was watery so we sent them all back. The crab dip was cold and was a bit less flavorful than the other dishes. The service was very friendly, attentive and recommended good options when they listened to what you were saying. They did try to give my husband a 16oz steak when he clearly asked for the 14oz so they could charge us more. The restaurant is nice in the main areas but the bathroom has short ceilings and needed some light cleaning. There was also a strong odor in the hostess area like an old, moldy smell. In short, I probably won't be back unless I’m just grabbing a quick drink and maybe an appetizer.""]"

You have to try the flaming bananas foster.', 'I came here wanting to like this place. It seemed promising, with live music, all located in a beautifully restored building. In reality, the food was very ‘American’ fancy: too large portions, with too much seasoning, for too much money. The wine they serve for $18 per glass is not worth that much as a bottle. The worst are the guests though. Drunk and stumbling seniors raging loudly at the bar over national politics with plenty of openly racist remarks. The guacamole appetizer and the Eggs Benedict were nice though, I give ‘em that.', ""Had the GULF FISH PONTCHARTRAIN and the Mrs. had the TEXAS SHRIMP & GRITS.  Both dishes were delicious!  Also had the Bananas Foster which was delicious too.  Decor inside definitely has a New Orleans feel to it.  Waitstaff were attentive and cordial.  Definitely recommended eating here if you're in the mood for upscale Creole."", 'Brennan’s is well known in Houston and I can see why.

We really liked the catfish and waffles.\n\nThe fries that came with the hot chicken sandwich were delicious! The sandwich was good, but it was more of a chili oil and not hot honey which is what I preferred, but still good. One of the kids knocked over a lemonade and they were quick to respond and were very kind about it.', ""Celebrated my birthday with my husband tonight at Lucille's and they did not disappoint. Rick took excellent care of us and all of his recommendations were on point! Boudin balls were really good and flavorful and the Best Friends cocktail was so good.

Unfortunately, our experience was disappointing. While the drinks during happy hour were enjoyable, the food fell flat. The appetizers were not fresh; the oxtail tamales felt out of place for a soul food restaurant, and the boudin balls were hard and unappetizing.\n\nFor the entrees, my husband ordered braised oxtails with collard greens, macaroni and cheese, and cornbread. The oxtails were fatty and lacked flavor, especially for $42. My mother’s yard bird was greasy, and my blackened catfish came with lumpy grits. I asked for mashed potatoes instead, but they too were bland and lumpy.\n\nOverall, for a soul food restaurant, the dishes had no soul. It’s disheartening to see such potential missed, and I believe the kitchen could benefit from some authentic culinary guidance. I won't be returning unless it's to offer some cooking lessons."", ""Lucille's, nestled in Houston's Museum District, is a gem I discovered during my recent business trip. I was so impressed that I dined there twice in my 5-day visit.\n\nThe food is outstanding. I sampled a variety of dishes including boudin balls, fried green tomatoes, shrimp and grits, and bread pudding. Each dish was expertly prepared and delicious. The Southern-inspired menu offers a perfect blend of comfort and sophistication.\n\nWhat really sets Lucille's apart is the exceptional service. The entire staff was attentive and engaging throughout both of my visits. Special mention goes to Rose the bartender, who remembered my drink order (an old fashioned) on my second visit - a thoughtful touch that made me feel like a regular despite being an out-of-towner.\n\nThe atmosphere at Lucille's is unique and charming. Housed in a converted residence, the restaurant exudes a cozy yet stylish vibe that perfectly complements the cuisine. Its location in the Museum District adds to its appeal, making it an ideal spot for a meal before or after exploring the area's cultural offerings.\n\nPractical note: They offer valet parking, which is convenient given the residential setting.\n\nOverall, Lucille's provided a memorable dining experience that I would highly recommend to both Houston locals and visitors. It's a must-visit for anyone seeking excellent Southern cuisine in a welcoming, distinctive atmosphere.""]"

She then informed me that they offered a 3- tier birthday cake & it would be $50, so I ordered their cake.\n\nOnce we arrived at the restaurant in June 24th, I saw several men wearing jeans, sneakers, work boots, & regular dry-fit shirts. Our waiter was very surface & not very welcoming or personable. He did his job,but there was nothing personable about him.\n\nAfter our diner, which was great, the cake arrived for my mother, it was like a $15 cake you get at any H-E-B., seen in the photos. I informed our waiter that we were expecting a three tier cake more suitable for a birthday celebration and we were informed it was $50, he said “that’s our standard birthday cake that we offer”. I asked to speak with a manager.\n\nOnce the manager came over, he was very apologetic & informed me that was NOT in fact their standard cake & that due to the hurricane, they borrowed a cake from Willie G’s, and that he would take the $50 charge for the cake off because they were not able to accommodate us with the correct cake. I wonder if I would have been charged if I had not asked for the manager because our waiter didn’t care to research what I stated.\n\nOverall, the food was great.

Aquarium Restaurant,4.4,4449,"['I had been excited for this restaurant since we moved down here and was looking forward to surprising my husband with a delicious and fun dining experience. Unfortunately, the decor was dated, almost dirty, and the tanks were so small I just felt sorry for the sea life. Granted we only visited the restaurant so the full aquarium may be different. They were serving the restaurant week menu but we opted for the full menu so we had more options. We started with the shrimp and crab dip which was the best part of the meal, but had a distinct oceany taste and the bread was overly crispy. For our entrees, we ordered the mariners mixed grill and the New Orleans seafood combo (on the Pacific Creations menu). I have never left a bite of steak or lobster on my plate until this meal. The food was barely edible, lacked seasoning, wasn’t cooked appropriately, and just didn’t taste good. My husband will literally eat anything and don’t finish his meal either -  the crab cake was much more bread than crab. Our drinks were often empty and our server was less than present. In general, felt like an overpriced lower tier family restaurant. I’m not sure what we were expecting, but we didn’t get it.

The place is aesthetically pleasing with a serene feeling. I sat outside on the patio and glad I did because it was so lovely! The service was professional and the job was handled. I ordered the artichoke chicken and the sauce with capers was fabulous, however the chicken was a tad dry. The rest of the meal, that included a salad and veggies were good. The price is on point, not overly pricey for the quality. I would recommend coming here and taking in the outdoors. Happy Eating! 🍽️', ""Was recommended by a coworker to try this place and I'm glad we did! The food was very flavorful and appealing. Everyone we encountered was very nice and accommodating. The outside dining area has great views however the flies kept trying to land on our food so we had to get an inside table. Definitely looking forward to trying other items on the menu!"", 'What a gem of a restaurant. Came to try out the prix fixe menu for restaurant week and the selection of dishes for the courses was well done and the wild game was well cooked and delicious. The pairing of sauces for the wild game-tasting plate was well thought out with the duck and venison being the highlights. The warm croissant bread pudding was decadent and a great way to round out the meal.']"
The Rustic,4.3,4990,"['No self parking on premises , only valet ($10). Weekend/brunch menu is very limited; however, the dishes we ordered were all good! (Burger, chicken salad, and salmon salad).

The waiter was very kind and made us laugh. We did have the happy hour frozen drinks. It wasn’t strong but it tasted pretty good.

Other than that, we had a good time.', ""It was one of the better restaurants I've been to during my stay in Houston. My nephew took me here for brunch. We had the family style spread.

Large and dramatic, with a distinctive character! The outdoor stage provides some wonderful entertainment and looks to be a great place to host private parties. The indoor bar and dining room are beautiful and provide a great option for people who prefer the comforts of sitting inside.\n\nOur food was not great, but good, overall. A few of the dishes that hit the nail on the head were the Tamales Three Ways, the Cedar Plank Salmon, and the Jalapeño Spoon Bread - all delicious. We were, however, quite disappointed with the pork and chicken tacos (served family style). We felt like they lacked flavor and creativity and as a featured menu item, should have been much better. This seemed to be a situation where quality may have been sacrificed for quantity. If you like tacos, I suggest avoiding these.\n\nOne important area for improvement was the service. Our waiter, Carter, didn’t mention the Happy Hour (3-6 PM) when we were seated at 5:00 PM and even after repeatedly telling him that we wanted to wait to order our entrees after enjoying some happy hour drinks and snacks, kept coming over to our table to ask if we wanted to order. This came off as pushy. Additionally, we had a problem with the check. After finally succumbing to Carter’s persistence and while ordering our entrees, we were informed that the Cedar Plank Salmon came with a side that was included in the price. When the bill arrived, the side appeared to be charged as an extra. Upon mentioning this, Carter confidently informed us that the $6.95 simply showed up on the bill, but was not included in the total (hint: it was included in the total and we had been, indeed, overcharged). After showing him the math, Management ultimately fixed our bill. Carter was appropriately apologetic (laying blame at a recently updated ordering computer system), but it does leave me wondering how many others have been similarly overcharged. An unfortunate end to an otherwise “good” early dinner.', 'The entire place was a vibe! If you’re looking for a quick bite to eat or even food in general (brunch, lunch and dinner), good drinks (so I was told) and some live music, this is the place.\n\nI went to this location for my sisters dinner. I was honestly not a big fan of the menu. However, it was an amazing atmosphere. My 19 month old had a good time and the service was phenomenal. I can see myself going back to try the appetizers. I am not a huge fan of burgers/sandwiches. I would explore more of the options next time. The vibes were that good, I will be returning. I think I was just tired. I think I’ll try one of the salads next time. My family enjoyed their meals and my son, loved the fries too.\n\nValet is $10 as well. There is free parking, idk where though lol.

Highly recommend\nV & A’s to make any event special.', ""The restaurant, located near the Astros' home base at Minute Maid Stadium, serves grill-based cuisine. The food is quite enjoyable, but perhaps for Asians, the aroma of the blue cheese in the salad will be quite disturbing, as will the taste. The meat served is delicious, with a medium well doneness that leaves a juicy taste from the meat juice. The place is quite comfortable, and there is a special room that can accommodate 20-30 people.

Hillstone continues to impress, making it a top choice for a quality lunch in Houston.', ""[July 2024 update: still fabulous and wonderful management by Shauna!] We've become regulars at Hillstone for good reasons: interesting food, terrific service and a great atmosphere. One of the nicest things is that even when it's busy, there's never a feeling of being rushed through your meal. You can relax and thoroughly enjoy the experience...and there are some wonderful dishes that deserve your full attention. My personal favorite has emerged as the Pan-Asian Salad with the chopped pork. (This is the same pork as the Knife and Fork Ribs.) I'm not much of a meat eater, but the server recommended this addition, and it was spot-on. It's exactly the right amount of pork to complement the salad without overwhelming it. Are you an artichoke fan? You must try the grilled artichoke appetizer with remoulade sauce. Enough to share with another person! Everything we've tried has been delicious, and I love getting a side dish as an appetizer. The Iron Skillet Baked Beans are among the best I've ever had. You definitely want to make a reservation even for non-peak times because this place is humming, and rightly so with such an enjoyable experience. Kudos all around!"", 'Love coming here for date night. The food is amazing and the service is excellent. We enjoy sitting in the bar area and their house made veggie burger is the best in town. Spinach artichoke dip (not pictured) is a must.', 'This is a great “Special Occasion” restaurant.\nThe food is always fantastic and the service (when I have gone) has always been top-notch.\nIf you like a brownie with ice cream on top for dessert, be warned that there are dried cherries in the brownie. It would have been a good dessert, if not for the dried cherries. I didn’t like to texture that it gave the brownie. On the other hand, the apple dessert is fantastic, as is every other dish that I have tried at Hillstone.\nFor those of you on a tight budget, this restaurant is quite expensive, so be prepared.

You serve yourself from items laid out on a long table in the center of the restaurant, dessert table also available. Although it’s a buffet the staff was attentive during our time there.\n\nParking was valet, with some side parking available on the street.

I had the redfish tacos and substituted my side for brussel sprouts and they were 10/10. We had a lot of fun, laughed with the staff and truly enjoyed our experience.', 'The restaurant is very nice inside.  We were greeted with a smile when we arrived and server was very sweet.  They offer a large wine menu if that’s your thing.  The lunch menu looked appealing with various options but surprisingly, we all chose salads that day, so I can’t tell you much more beyond that.  I had the Greek salad with a salmon steak that I enjoyed.  The salmon was medium the way I like it but was not as flavorful or seasoned as I would have preferred.  My friends complained of lackluster chicken too.  Overall it wasnt a bad experience at Ouise’s but it certainly wasn’t that impressive either.   I did appreciate the aesthetics of the restaurant and the valet parking was convenient for a $5 fee.   I might give it another chance.  I think it has the potential for being better than it was this time.', 'Ouisie’s Table hosted a dinner event for us that turned out lovely! They were easy to communicate with and service was excellent. The food choices were great—we chose a fixed menu where guests had three options and everyone was extremely pleased.

We will be back soon!', ""I was here to officiate a wedding and this is my first time being here. While I wasn't here to eat, the atmosphere of this place is elegant.

Come and check it out!"", 'Always a great lunch spot. Sandwiches, salads, and chicken fried chicken are all great.\n\nInsider tip: they have a great patio that is almost always empty of y or want a quiet spot.

Plenty of parking and the service was great.  My only complaint is that the temperature of the restaurant was very warm.  We had to keep 2 menus to use as fans.', 'Whoa, whoa, whoa. Riel’s, you rock!

Hoping I can make my way back to Houston so I can try even more of their innovative foods. Thanks Riel!', ""The service was great, the atmosphere was great, but there were some nit picks here and there between my friends and I about the food.

The food is good, though for some plates the portions are on the smaller side. The dico cowboy cocktail is really good. The classics are ok. The Nutella cheesecake was very good.

The atmosphere is beautiful, romantic, but also cool and relaxed. The best part about this restaurant is the service. Since the second I pulled into the parking lot to the second I left, we were treated like Harden himself! Our server Corey was truly the standard that everyone should aspire to be. He was knowledgeable, super friendly, charming and knew everything about each dish as if he prepared it himself. We also had wonderful service by the management Sean and Kevin.

I’d recommend the lamb chops for sure very flavorful. Also you MUST get an appetizer we tried 2 different ones both were amazing; especially one with the spicy sauce! The only thing I didn’t enjoy was the super loud music!

Marcus was our server and he went above and beyond to explain the menu and what he felt were his  favorites. It really helped us first timers decide on what to choose. The only minor issue we had was that we ordered our steak medium rare and it arrived medium well done. A new one was quickly prepared and it was totally worth the wait! Will definitely be returning with my girlfriends soon!', ""Food was delicious. Those dumplings... *chef's kiss* absolute perfection.  The chef and the manager, Kevin, actually came out and talked to me.  I love the renovation.\nAnd let's talk about my server, Taylor.\nMy girl was attentive and kind and made fire recommendations.

Doesn’t accommodate a lot of people, but it’s nice. The food was fantastic. The service was fantastic. The speedway we got our food was fantastic. Even the coffee was on point.

I can see how this place could get packed, and a wait time could be a problem, but it is what it is on any given weekend in Houston trying to get breakfast. If you’re going to wait, you might as well wait for good food and just not complain about it. Parking is extremely tight, and spaces are tight, but there’s plenty of street parking.

Awesome place to come if you enjoy sharing plates.', ""We went back to Hamsa on Friday night for dinner and while I did find it to be a definite improvement on our last visit I still felt like there was room for improvement. We were seated right when we arrived for our 6:45 reservation. The restaurant was lively but not at capacity while we were there. We were able to order our cocktails right away and easily throughout the course of our meal and service overall was very good. We started with the Wholeshebang (added a side of cucumber) which I quiet enjoyed, though the restaurant was a little to loud for me to be able to hear what each dish was when the waiter brought them to the table. We also got the roasted cabbage, octopus, hangar steak, chicken kabob (off menu special) and the cauliflower couscous. My favorite dish of the evening was the roasted cabbage, it was smoky and crispy and delicious. My main critique is of the general ambiance. I feel like they are aiming to be an upscale restaurant and while the interior does feel that way I feel like there is also a distinctly casual vibe. Generally speaking I think that is fine, but for the menu price point I wouldn't mind it feeling a little less laid back. Like the menus could still be paper but maybe a cardstock instead of something that I could have printed off at home. It just feels like it is missing some elevated details."", 'Had dinner last night for the first time at Hamsa. We loved everything about it. I love that we finally have a great Israeli restaurant in Houston. Hummus was perfection. Pita bread as good as it gets. The smoked Eggplant was fantastic and the smoky flavor penetrated the whole dish and was wonderful. The best part of the meal was the Steak skewers. The beef was delicious. The side salad was great.\nService was excellent and very attentive. Our waiter refilled our water as soon as we took a few sips.\nHighly recommended', 'This is a new favorite for me. The food is mouthwatering goodness, beautifully plated and perfectly paired. This little spot in Rice Village manages to stroke the perfect balance between casual but posh and not expensive but excellent quality so you get a lot of bang for your buck. The happy hour is a perfect time to go if you are looking for a less expensive, quiet intimate date or friend check in. The service is out of this world and the indoor outdoor duality gives it a Cali feel in the middle of Houston. I can’t wait to come back for more! I can’t recommend enough the hummus it’s lamb which was velvety smooth and packed with flavor.', ""It's a winner!

Probably the best in all OF HOUSTON. And for 4 pounds, I thought it to be reasonably priced.  The chicken Parmesan also probably the best in Houston.

For dessert we had the cheesecake which was also excellent.\nOur waiter Ramon was attentive and always there when we needed him. Also, when the lobster was brought I cannot remember the waiter’s name, but he did a great job of cracking the majority of it so it was easy to navigate on the plate.\nAt the end of the evening on our way out, Tony was kind enough to give us a tour of the entire restaurant. It is deceivingly large. He showed us through each of the private rooms which have a different theme and we were extremely impressed.\nAnd as a bonus, the GM, Brian sent us a thank you email the following morning.\nYou don’t see that with the restaurants these days.\nVery impressed.\nCan 100% recommend the PALM HOUSTON for their food and their service and just an overall wonderful experience.

Idk HOW 3 separate tables arrived AFTER us got their food BEFORE us but I def clocked it! It took approximately 30 minutes to get our food.

Super-fresh and you can literally taste the sea. But why didn't they get a 5 star on food? The sides/add-on were not a good complement to the main. For example, I love their crab guacamole, but the plantain chip were not crunchy. This devalues the entire dish. I saw a few people didn't even eat the plantain chip. If they would just air-fry it a bit so it's crunchy, this dish would be perfect. Same for the mash potato that came with the king crab.

Although a lot has changed about the place, i.e. they do not serve breakfast anymore, I did find that the food was still good. I had the oxtails, greens, yeah at corporate. I also tried the sweet potato pie, the chocolate cake, the red velvet cake and the lemon cake. The desserts were not as decadent as they used to be.

Nobie's,4.6,912,"['New Favorite Restaurant! We had 3 apps and split the winner winner chicken dinner for our main. Everything we ordered had so much flavor and was so different from the other items. Fired up oysters with toppings and flavors of a big mac, roast chicken dinner fit for a medieval feast. Olive oil cake and cinnamon toast crunch pie to finish it all off. Highly highly recommend.', 'We recently visited another amazing restaurant on the James Beard list and were thoroughly pleased. The fresh ingredients and vibrant flavors made my stomach and taste buds sing. As someone who loves to eat and drink, I’ve become very discerning about flavors, and this place did not disappoint.\n\nBoth appetizers were fantastic. The house-made salt and vinegar chips with smoked fish dip, aptly named ""When You Dip, We Dip, You Dip,"" were irresistible. I had to try them, and they were amazing. The claw chowder croquettes came out hot and delicious, setting the stage for the meal to come. Each dish was crafted beautifully and with love, and I could taste every bit of that care and flavor.\n\nThe drinks were equally impressive. The Paloma and their guava-inspired cocktail, which caught my nose before my eye, were fresh and delightful. Sitting at the bar, I enjoyed watching the bartender create these masterpieces. With fresh-squeezed fruits and top-shelf liquors, these drinks made me dance with joy.\n\nOverall, I’m very pleased and look forward to visiting Nobie’s again!', 'We came bc our family gave us a gift card to go check it out. The smoked fish was served with veg and chips. We liked eating the veggies with the dip. Next, we had grilled oysters. It was shucked well and served well. Then for our entrees, we had the eggplant and the Charlie pasta factory dishes. I took close ups so you can get an idea of what is in it. Sometimes it’s like a big mash up in other pics, but when you eat each of them - they had a lot of taste and texture. If you like to “see” your food or have grains separated from veggies etc, you might not enjoy this place. We didn’t make it for dessert, but the olive oil cake was in the back of my mind.\n\nWe took the food home for leftovers and we gotta say that we enjoyed the food as good as the first day', 'This place was fantastic, the food, the music, the atmosphere was super romantic, perfect for a get together with friends or date, you get a lot of food for appetizer, a unique blend of ingredients and everything is made from scratch, very unique place for sure! We’ll go back. Our waitress Ginger was so sweet and knowledgeable! Great food and service!', 'Wow, this is one of the best meals we’ve had in a long time. The service was amazing and we had some remarkable dishes. The grilled oysters were amazing. The quail and the clam chowder croquettes were amazing. The grilled artichoke was fantastic and then we finish it off with the best olive cake we’ve ever had olive oil cake we have ever had. The bartenders are fantastic and make you whatever you want.']"

The oxtail and grits had the perfect blend of flavors, and the gumbo was delicious. The jerk chicken had just the right amount of spice, and the cheesecake was the best I’ve ever had.

We finished before 9:50 PM but didn’t receive our bill until 10:06 PM, and then got hit with the fee. While I’ll definitely return for the food, I don’t recommend going late since these fees aren’t mentioned or listed on the menu. We ended up paying almost $15 per ticket, and there were only four of us. I would recommend letting people know this. Besides this we were welcomed with love and smiles.

It was very crowded, and I politely asked our server, to rush if possible (it was not a demand but a request) and  bring our appetizer with our main course together, since we were in a time crunch. His response was that everyone is going for a show. Fair enough, he wanted to share that thought. Then he said that he cannot promise how it will come out (I don't exactly know what he meant by that -- did he mean that the food will not be satisfactory).Then while deciding on the appetizer, we were looking at the asparagus with crab or escargot. I clearly told him that we wanted the escargot ....when our food came, it was the asparagus. I pointed that out to the person who had served the food.  The manager was there, he was very gracious and he took the plate away to replace it with escargot. My daughter wanted them to leave the asparagus behind, but we are paying enough money and it is reasonable to expect the food we ordered. If it was a mom and pop place, then I would have let it go.\nThe server later came by to tell me that I had ordered the asparagus. I know I was very clear about escargot and my daughter had heard me too. Mistakes can happen, it is restaurant everyone was rushed. The fact that the server thought it was okay for him to argue, was not right. An establishment like this, should do better.\nThe food is alright. I liked the creme brulee...."", 'This is a perfect place to get a really good dinner before going to the theater.

My Mom got to hear music she knew! Food was good. Creme brulee was great!!"", ""I got the linguine primavera. It was okay, nothing to write home about. I wish I'd gotten something that had a little bit more flavor to it. It was a good portion, but the $5 upcharge for chicken was definitely not worth it. Chicken was okay. Very bland palette\n\nHowever, my server was freaking awesome. I forgot to grab her name, but she had really lovely braids with beads in them and 2 nose studs. Very kind and we had a fun back and forth. She was very efficient and thorough\n\nIs a cute place too, I was seated near the front so I didn't get a great look around, but it was a nice place, with some pretty art to look at and very relaxed atmosphere. There was somebody singing and playing music too. He was okay"", 'What a pleasant surprise! Immaculate venue, with live soft jazz and pop in the background.

It was a wonderful experience! They really treat people well here.\n\nI would highly recommend for special occasions. We had Jose and Daniel as our servers and they did a phenomenal job. The food was delicious with generous portions. Don't forget to save room for dessert! The Baked Alaska was such a treat."", 'Bludorn in Houston is a total gem. The black truffle pasta?

The peach dessert is light and refreshing, the perfect sweet finish. Even the bread and butter are amazing—freshly baked bread with butter that just melts in your mouth. With top-notch service and an attention to detail, Bludorn is a must-visit for a fantastic dining experience in Houston.', ""The experience would have been superb had we've been seated inside instead of outside in the patio.   The patio would be nice in cooler weather but right now, it's not so great.  We had to continuously shoed flies away even though our nice waiters brought us the bug away wipes and the table spinners.  Albeit the mugginess and flies, we did enjoy the food and service.  Everything we ordered was very good.  After dinner we went inside to the bar for more drinks then hopped to another place.  Parking is either valet or on the streets, I was lucky to find one across from the restaurant."", ""Bludorn delivered a truly exceptional dining experience that exceeded our expectations. From the moment we stepped in, the ambiance was lively and energetic, though it did lean towards the loud side.\n\nThe star of the show was undoubtedly the grilled octopus. Perfectly cooked, bursting with flavor, it was a standout dish. The short rib ravioli and crab jollof rice were equally impressive, showcasing the chef's talent for creating fresh and delicious flavors. While the pesto flatbread was decent, it didn't quite match the caliber of the other dishes.\n\nThe dessert, a classic Baked Alaska, was a delightful finale, complete with a fun and engaging presentation by our attentive server. The service throughout the evening was impeccable, adding to the overall enjoyment of our special night out.\nWe also indulged in a few cocktails, which were fantastic and complemented our meal perfectly.\n\nIf you're looking for a memorable dining experience with fantastic food, great service, and delicious cocktails, Bludorn is definitely worth a visit.""]"

The food is lightly seasoned. I prefer bursting with flavor, so be prepared for that. The salmon was ok, nothing special. The lobster Mac and cheese was decent.

It\'s a great way to try some of Houston\'s top dining spots while supporting a good cause.\n\nMy experience at BCN Taste & Tradition was a mix of highs and lows. The restaurant has a beautiful, elegant atmosphere that states sophistication—almost to the point of feeling a bit too pretentious. Think ""sit up straight with your pinky in the air while sipping espresso"" kind of vibe. It\'s clearly a place designed for those who appreciate the finer things in life, but it can come off as a bit over the top.\n\nThey’re known for their gin and tonics, which is a unique and cool aspect of the restaurant. I decided to try the squid rice with Branzino. While the portion of rice was generous, the fish itself was almost comically small—maybe about 3/4 oz. My fiancé opted for the duck, which our waiter warned us would be a small portion as well. The duck was delicious, but the portion size was indeed tiny, especially given the price point.\n\nThe food was good, but I couldn\'t help but feel like I was paying for the atmosphere more than anything. For what we spent, we could have gone somewhere else and actually left feeling full. While BCN Taste & Tradition certainly delivers on ambiance and presentation, the portion sizes left much to be desired.

We don't live in Texas anymore; Eater Houston highly recommended this place.   We made reservations though they weren't necessary.  And we parked quite far away she walked while valet parking had empty spaces.\n\nWe had the focaccia bread and the octopus to start.  Both were excellent, though the bread seemed a bit under salted.  We asked for some salt, which they gladly delivered to the table.  The bread was fantastic once we added a bit of salt.\n\nThe Bucatini in tomato sauce was fantastic.  Oh so rich and flavorful.  The pork Milanese was fine but not worthy of a repeat order;  it was crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, and seemed to be missing a sauce.    The rusted cauliflower we shared and it was fantastic.  Nothing was left on that plate!"", 'Absolutely delicious! I’ve been here several times but tonight was the first for my husband. He is extremely picky! Happy to say he LOVED it. I was soo proud! When I say he is picky, I mean it! The service was incredible as always and the food was amazing. I highly recommend family style. You get to taste a little of everything!', 'The good here is superb. Service was attentive and dessert was delicious. Would 100% return again to have a wonderful dinner.', 'Wanted to try it but was on a work trip and couldn’t make it to the restaurant so ordered it delivered. Was excited to try it after hearing the ties to barbuto in nyc which I’ve been to. The gnocchi lived up to expectations. Loved it! Great tomato sauce and seafood with it.\nThe Caesar salad was good but a bit heavy on the dressing. Could’ve felt that way due to the delay in eating it with getting it delivered but wish it had less dressing or I should’ve asked for dressing on the side. Good potential with it tho.\nI also ordered the tiramisu which was good but a bit intense / heavy on the booze. Was hard to finish with the strong booze flavor. Also good potential on this dish.\nWould love to try it out in the restaurant sometime in the future.']"
Oporto Fooding House & Wine,4.6,1587,"['Came here for my birthday. Coincidentally, went to De Gama last year who is their sister restaurant. Food was incredible.\n\nBeen wanting to come here for a while since my abroad trip to Portugal.\nMade reservations and noted the special occasion. Oddly, we were seated next to the bathroom and in a crowded “work function?” Towards the back of the restaurant. Not even sure why I make reservations anywhere, anymore.\n\nI want to try the squid ink rice next! The octopus was really good but the mussels.. man let me tell you. Order a nice white or green wine and have that with sour dough bread. Chefs kiss 😘', ""This is such a fantastic spot for a great happy hour!\n\nJust a heads up on parking! Oporto offers valet but they also have a garage where you can validate your parking but it's about a 5 minute walk from there to the restaurant. When filling out the parking payment on your phone, don't feel scared to put your credit card info in because after it has 'processed your payment', it will ask you for the restaurant's validation code and the server will provide it for you. But definitely don't forget to pay as soon as you park (or at least within 10-20 minutes) because my friend got a boot on her car.\n\nOkay back to the review!\nThe interior feels cozy and is decorated well (the bathrooms are also very nice)! I made reservations for 5 people on Friday at 5:00 pm for their Happy Hour which ends at 6:30.\nWe ordered the Avocado & Salmon Tartine, Berinjelas, Lulas Fritas, Grilled Chorizo & Romesco, Piri Piri Chicken Wings, and Prego Baguette.\nEverything we had was absolutely delicious but the crowd favorite were the:\n- Lulas Fritas\nYou would think the squid is the main star of the show (and it was fantastic) but honestly, the grilled baguette was perfection\n- Piri Piri Chicken Wings\nThe exterior wasn't crunchy enough for my liking but the chicken was moist and the tomato piri piri sauce was delicious\n- Grilled Chorizo & Romesco\nThis was my personal favorite. The char on these Spanish-style sausages were incredible. Rich in flavor and paired with the acidity from the tomato sauce, it was *chef's kiss*\n- Berinjelas\n○ Great vegetarian option! The description says eggplant salad but it's more of a spread for the naan. Tasted refreshing and I enjoyed the charmoula marinade\n- Avocado & Salmon Tartine\n○ Taste-wise, everything was fine but I don't think I'd go out of my way to order this again\n- Prego Baguette\n○ Delicious but the portion is quite small. If you're ordering this for yourself, not a bad idea but since I had a party of 5, it wasn't exactly the best dish to get. The fries were great to share though!\n\nOther than the food, we also had several carafe's of the Sangria Oporto which was delicious. Aside from the delicious food and drinks, our waiter was fantastic and I cannot wait to come back!"", 'Always coming back!\nOporto is just a great solution when you want to try different tastes of familiar ingredients prepared in South European way. There is a huge span of small plates combining seafood and potatoes, over different types of meat and desserts. Very important, these things are followed with authentic wine list. Unmistakable the best choice is paella which is more than enough for two people without anything else. Desserts are great and people working here very professional and pleasant. Good spot for birthday celebrations or business dinners as well!', 'This is my favorite restaurant in Houston, the service is always outstanding, the food is high quality and the flavor is amazing. They have amazing cocktails. The ambiance is incredible, we enjoy from start to end. I highly recommend this place even to the more picky eaters. You are not going to be disappointed.', 'Absolutely delicious, portion sizes were a little larger than prior visits. Ordered lamb ribs, scallops (2 per order, ordered extra scallop), seafood curry, shrimp and focaccia bread. The early dinner slots (5:00-6:30 pm) are usually easy to reserve a table and receive great service. We have tried 70% of the tapas menu but always stick with our favorites noted above.']"

I highly recommend this place for people looking for a nice lunch!', 'This restaurant is located inside the Westin Hotel and I came here for a late lunch with a friend. I decided to indulge in their Houston Restaurant Week Menu and chose the Summer Bliss Salad, Branzino, and Ube Lavendar Cake. My friend ordered the Linguini Pesto.\n\nThe summer bliss salad was light, refreshing, and actually pretty filling. It was the perfect way to start the meal on a hot summer day. As for the Branzino, the fish was great, and the risotto was wonderful (not exactly sure if I was able to taste the lavender though). But the star of this dish was the Shug sauce- super flavorful and I wish I could take home a jar of it with me. I also tried some of my friend’s Linguini Pesto and the pasta was nice & al dente and the pesto sauce was delightful.\n\nOne thing I noticed from the beginning is that the service here is pretty slow. It took a while to get every dish but the servers are all very kind and I appreciate them doing their best. One thing I wish was different about my dining experience is that I wish I was told ahead of time about how they ran out of Ube Lavendar Cake. This was the dish I was looking forward to the most but to wait until the very end and be told that they don’t have any more was a little bit of a let down. Instead, I opted out for the Bread Pudding which was great!\n\nOverall, pretty decent spot for food but if you go here, it’s best to make sure you have extra time to spare.', 'Our server Brandon was amazing! The new appetizer menu is amazing.

David did a superb job explaining each wine selection as it was served. My stepmother's dietary restrictions were given top priority to ensure that she also enjoyed her meal. Went with the cheesecake for dessert this time and it was off the charts delicious! We will go back again and again. Cannot say enough about how much we love this place. Special shout out to Damarys, too. She provided excellent service to our table as well! Atmosphere was great! Not too loud this time. Bump atmosphere rating from 4 stars to 5!\n\nMay 18, 2024: Chose Capital Grille to celebrate our wedding anniversary and were very happy with our experience! Our table was prepared with an anniversary theme before we arrived (we had reservations) and set the tone for our celebration from the moment we sat down. Our server, David, was very attentive to every aspect of our experience and ensured we were well taken care of. In fact all of the staff were amazing. The food was near perfect and did not disappoint. The minor issues we had - burnt and bitter garlic in the spinach and too salty scallops - were immediately addressed and corrected without hesitation. The lamb chops and bone-in filet mignon were cooked to perfection and exceeded expectations. The scallops add-on were incredible. For sides we had the sauteed spinach and mashed potatoes and recommend 100%! The flourless chocolate espresso cake was the perfect accompaniment to finish our bottle of Malbec. Our only criticism would be with regard to the atmosphere... it was extremely loud and difficult for us to have a conversation at our table. But that is more the fault of the other parties seated around us. 9/10 we will be back again!"", 'Came in last Saturday for friends birthday. Table was decorated with confetti and a card from the restaurant. Manuel took good care of us. Most of us ordered the HRW menu and ordered apps on the regular. Steak tartar was under seasoned. Lobster bisque was delicious. Chicken breast was moist. Filets were cooked perfect medium rare and seasoned. NY strip was a little charred. Mash potatoes were spot on creamy with some lumps. Spinach was very cheesy. Lobster Mac and cheese was good. Cheesecake and espresso cake were yummy as well.', ""Always a pleasure to come dine and enjoy the romantic atmosphere and superb staff. Thank y'all for making another anniversary so memorable. Looking forward to coming back time and time again!"", ""Great service and amazing food! Chef's specials were delicious (my 1.5 year old, particularly enjoyed the Filet Mignon :) ). A perfect way to selebrated a belated birthday with the in-laws!

I do like how quick my food came out.   The biscuit was a bit salty and  crunchy but maybe would have been better with some jam/preserve instead of butter. I had the whole snapper and it comes with some sort of red curry sauce which was is salty and sour tasting. I would recommend you get that on the side. The fish was cooked well but it battered in what appears to be cornmeal type batter, but I would consider adding more seasoning to the fish or marinating longer for flavor. I ate it with hot sauce since I didn't like the curry sauce. I also had a side of broccolini  which was a bit tough to cut and chew (not sure if it was the dull silverware) and also salty. I also had the ginger mule drink and it was very refreshing for a hot day. The ambience of restaurant is very nice, vibe is fun with r&b music in the background and it's clean but those cracked green tufted chairs are not aesthicaly pleasing. I would like to come back and bring some friends during the live entertainment. It would be awesome if they offer some more vegetarian options on the menu."", 'We went on a Friday. They were playing live music. The only complaint I have is it was really loud. I wasn’t expecting that tbh. It’s more of an older crowd and they played old school  music. Not really my vibe but I’m sure it could be for others out there. I had the catfish. It’s decent. I also tried the lamb chops. That was different. It was more of a blueberry flavor. Very interesting choice. Overall for what they’re offering it’s great. Just not quite my style.', 'A great spot to grab a drink & some amazing food there is something on the menu for everyone to enjoy.

Cuchara,4.3,3938,"[""My best friend and I were here recently for dinner on a Saturday night.  First encounter was with the valet who really sells the food and atmosphere to customers.  He told me he was from Mexico City and that the food was authentic and amazing - great start!  We were attended by a very sweet young lady called Susannah. She made excellent recommendations for drinks and food.  She made our drinks herself - Mexican Martini and Charlie's Devil, both were delicious.  We ordered Queso de Fogata and Empanadas de Jaiba for apps.  The queso was good but the empanadas were the best.  For dinner, we had Asado de Res Dona Julia and Mixiotes de Camaron.  The asado was the most delicious meal - the flavour, the tenderness of the meat and vegetables - superb!  After dinner, we moved to the bar and drank carajillos - highly recommend this.  Parking in that area is always challenging but they have their own car park with valet parking for $10, worth it to not have to street side park and walk down.

As a food lover, I have tried many different versions of this dish, but none have ever come close to the perfection and masterful execution of the Lamb Chops at this restaurant. The moment I take my first bite, I am transported to a world of delicious flavors and textures.

The meat for both dishes was very soft and tasty. The rosemary taste in the Tomahawk chop was very strong that gave the meat a slight bitter taste. Also, both dishes were a little bit salty.

Overall, we liked the food, but you can find a better elsewhere with a much cheaper price', 'Honestly not great, not how I remember it. Bartender was getting crushed and service was slow because of it. Once manger got team to jump in, one lady had already left mid dinner. My steak had good flavor but was easily MW not MR, so of course it was dry. Spinach was good. Old fashioned was heavy handed on the simple syrup.

The tomato toast was delicious and the one of the pasta dishes we tried was great. But the two fish dishes were disappointing. One had a fishy taste… fresh fish is not supposed to taste fishy.

Sitting at the Bar here is really the way to go. I love watching the team put the dishes together. You can really see how much thought and care goes into every menu item.

All around a fantastic place.', 'Overall a very unique experience. When I first pulled up, the building and surrounding complex seemed empty. I, for one, felt like Google maps took me to the wrong place.

Of this, and the breakdown of their menu, I was appreciative.\n\nRegarding the actual taste of the food, I have had better, and my opinion fluctuates with each dish I was served. I was not enamored by the pasta, but the tomato toast was great. The pasta was heavy, tasted mainly like shallots, and was overwhelmed by noodle.\n\nWould I come again? Yea, why not.

We both had the macaroni and cheese and it was so creamy and delicious. My parents shared the fried liver and gizzards, which they enjoyed and was a good size appetizer. My one complaint was that it was a bit warm inside the restaurant. I don’t know if it’s normally like that or maybe something happened with their air conditioning.

A little pricey but still good.', ""I truly enjoyed all of the food and the nice, quiet dining experience. The staff was professional and efficient. My food was made to order, and the prices were very reasonable. My only dislike was the cost of the oysters.

I was told no because there was a reservation. The second hostess who turned out to be a manager told me there were no tables and tables were for reservations. I told her I had a reservation and she went through the reservations as she didn’t believe  had one. I was annoyed because I could tell she didn’t believe me and after she went through the trouble of looking it was pointless because she told me I had to sit in the back of the restaurant or at the bar. I have a disability and said repeatedly that it was difficult for me to sit at a high table. I hadn’t ate so I just said don’t worry about it as I was hungry and didn’t feel well. I sat at the bar with my friend. The bartender was extremely nice and accommodating. She was helpful with the drinks and my lemon drop was amazing. My friend ordered some drink and said it was good. The manager did come back and apologize for the mix up and tried to get us a table . She also ordered us pretzels for the table which was kind .  The atmosphere was really nice and I loved being able to see the food be cooked. I love the aesthetic. I ordered the spinach dip and it was very filling and it was good. I felt like the dip was good but was missing something. I’d give the dip a 4/5. The lemon drop a 5/5, the salmon 4/5, and the salad a 3/5.  I was also unaware that the manager took our drinks off of our tab. Overall it was a decent experience and I plan to go back. I’d like to give them another chance and try their steak as the patron next to me ranted and raved about the steak!', ""This experience was kind of forgettable. The service was a little non existent. The food was pretty boring, just generic bar food. The dip was nothing exceptional. The bacon, avocado, tomato bread left a lot to be desired. I think I got like 10 crumbles of bacon, the tomatoes needed some seasoning and I could barely find the avocado smear. The bread was delicious though. The oysters were the best thing we ate. Not super briny, but good oysters. Drinks were pretty blah too. For the price you pay for them, with a really big cool looking bar, I would have hoped for a better garnish or something to make it look inviting. It was a bummer because it's got a really cool name and looks really interesting, but it wasn’t."", 'We had an amazing time here for lunch! Located in downtown Phoenix it was really busy and I was happy I made reservations. Hubby ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich with fries and I had the Mediterranean Chopped Chicken. The size of the salad is generous and being a light eater, I almost finished it all because it was so darn tasty! Call me crazy, I do enjoy a good salad. Alex took care of us and he did not steer us wrong with the delicious Sticky Caramel Cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream (dairy-free made with coconut milk). I highly recommend this dessert!

However, parking was not easy, as only roadside paid parking was available. They validate the parking for restaurant guests.\n\nAs for the food, we tried a variety of dishes. The oysters received a perfect score of 5 out of 5, while the poke bowl unfortunately only rated 2 out of 5. The salmon dish earned a solid 4 out of 5, and the crispy chicken was another standout with a score of 5 out of 5. Regrettably, we found the poke bowl to be lacking in freshness, and there may have been an issue with the rice. Upon bringing this to the attention of the manager, she promptly addressed our concerns and replaced the dish, which I greatly appreciated.\n\nOverall, I am truly pleased with the level of service we received at Phoenix downtown."", ""We just got to our hotel and had to wait for check in, was looking for a place to eat and relax from the plane ride- since I was visiting for a chef convention I knew I wanted to eat good food, and found this gem!\nWe decided to share a few appetizers and have some drinks while we waited. Service was fantastic, really cool atmosphere with open bar and kitchen concept which was cool to see. Really great service, drinks were brought out right away, I got the special cocktail (venetian smoke) and my wife had a mule and margarita all very refreshing, then a local craft beer that was fantastic.\nWe shared the salmon rilette, truffle fries, crispy shrimp, and Brussels sprouts- I still don't think I could pick a favorite, they were all really freshly prepared and delicious! The four appetizers was enough food for us to split although there were 6 other things at least that I'd want to try next time.\nI highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for anything from a nice casual lunch to a gourmet dinner, everything was fantastic and the price was right""]"
Seasons 52,4.6,2349,"['Seasons 52 in Phoenix is a culinary delight! The American-style food is not only delicious but also incredibly fresh. I was particularly impressed with the seafood—each dish showcased vibrant flavors and quality ingredients. The tender steaks were cooked to perfection, delivering a satisfying experience with every bite. What truly sets this place apart are the unique little chip desserts; they are a fun and delightful end to the meal, offering a variety of flavors in a bite-sized format. The atmosphere is upscale yet inviting, making it perfect for any occasion. The staff were attentive and knowledgeable, enhancing the overall experience. I highly recommend Seasons 52 for anyone looking to indulge in fresh, high-quality American cuisine!', 'All the food we got was delicious! I absolutely loved their scallops, it was tender and flavorful. The soup of the day was some kind of chowder and it was delicious. I went during AZ restaurant week and I tried with desserts and it was nice and sweet. Would come again! the server was very attentive to us and always made sure our drinks were refilled.', 'We tried Seasons 52 for our anniversary dinner recently, making reservations in advance, and we were immediately impressed with the ambiance of the restaurant. Low lighting and nicely spaced tables provided a romantic and peaceful atmosphere for the occasion. I was impressed with the staff, both with how professional they were and with how their uniforms were classy and non gender specific. Since the restaurant is at the mall, there was plenty of parking, and two entrances as well (mall side and parking lot side). The inside was spacious, spread out among different rooms, and would be a good place for large groups. We enjoyed the special attention we received for our anniversary, including a handwritten wish on our dessert plate. We ordered the potato leek soup, the sea bass, shrimp and grits, sweet potato casserole, baked potato casserole, and 4 of their mini desserts. Everything was delicious. We particularly appreciated the flavor of the soup, the reasonable price point, and the portion sizes of the dessert choices. I love desserts, but I often only want a few bites, so these were perfect. Afterward, we walked put thru the mall entrance where the walkway is lit up with a delightful amount of twinkle lights, topping off a very nice evening.', 'The ambience of this restaurant is warm and welcoming. Service was excellent. Lana was a great waitress and we appreciated her suggestion and service. We had the botanical Smash to drink, a refreshing and tart beverage. We shared the chicken pesto flatbread, slow roasted meatballs and the street corn. All three dishes were very good. We tried two mini desserts; the key lime pie and pecan cheesecake. Both were yummy, the perfect size and not overly sweet.', ""The best healthiest tastiest food I've had in a while. Loved the  ambience and customer service. We were greeted by Dominic who saw us waiting and got us checked in and seated.  The food was prepared perfectly and was just right. Not too little. Not too much.

There are fireplaces and really nice string lights as well that really set the mood when the sun set.\n\nStarted with some drinks and the Parmesan Truffle Fries. Delicious! The drinks menu is a good size, good selection of local breweries on tap!\n\nWe ordered the Caesar Salad with salmon and the Grilled Shrimp Taco Platter. Both good, but the taco platter stole the show! It comes with 3 tacos and they were fantastic! Everything was so fresh and tons to fill your taco with.

Can't wait to come back."", 'Date night with Mrs. V. Speaking as a foodie, I am a big fan of Fox Restaurant Concepts. (FRC) I have yet to be disappointed by their unique and  amazing eateries. I decided to try The Henry in part because it’s located in Arcadia, which is one of my fave restaurant districts facing the Camelback Mountains. When we walked in I immediately felt as though this is a place where a lot of repeat diners or ‘regs’ love to dine and enjoy cocktails at their large and inviting L shaped bar as the sign above the entrance indicates, “The Greatest Neighborhood Restaurant” Despite being 45 minutes early (overestimated traffic from Surprise) we were greeted and seated within minutes. Shorty after our server, Chase arrived at our table. Chase quite frankly made tonight’s dining experience one of the most memorable in a very long time. Chase was extremely friendly, knowledgeable, genuine and engaging. Chase made several recommendations from the menu, all of which were spot on. From apps to entrees the food was extraordinarily delicious! Chase surprised us with a complimentary dessert of bread pudding fresh from their own bakery which was very thoughtful and flavorful. In addition to their scratch made kitchen and bakery, there is also a coffee bar. While we were enjoying dinner. I couldn’t help but marvel at how well staffed and managed this restaurant is. If I could I would give  The Henry 10/5 ⭐️’s! We will definitely be back! Highly recommend!!']"
Chelsea’s Kitchen,4.6,3347,"[""3rd visit,  2 brunch and one after work,  food is excellent, and service.  Prices are a little high, even accounting that everything is up.  Great French press coffee. The Santa Fe Red Chili was exceptional, the Rib Hash too.  If anybody can make Kale Salad tasty, it's this cook, V\nvery well done.  If you aren't there early and I mean within 15 min of opening, on the weekend,  most all the parking spots are blocked off for valet.  We were yesterday at 10:45 and got the last 2 spaces.  Friend arrives 11:15, circled the lot for 2 spots bring vacated, but Valet claimed them.  The Valet look friendly but they are a little ubrupt and not friendly. It's hectic, and there is not enough parking. Valet cars are stacked in tight. The place was packed when we left.  It was too hot to eat outside even with shade and misters, but it was also 100% full. I love the food, service and atmosphere and will return. Plan your visit around less busy windows to account for parking and crowds."", ""Great time! Good food and great patio! I had a green chili burger and some fries, cooked to the perfect temp, mid-rare. No complaints. The waitress was super nice and I never felt like I needed anything that she didn't already offer me. I will definitely come back here again."", ""We came across this place last week while walking by and we decided to give it a try as the parking lot was full at that time , as well\nas their backyard patio...plus it smelled so good.\nSo here we are! We arrived around 3 o'clock and although there were many people inside, getting a table was not an issue. We were asked if we wanted to stay inside or outside and we opted for outside. They do have some misters ( fan style ones) and there are many trees which helps with keeping the heat more bearable. They have a big bar area and many patrons were sitting there. Their kitchen is right by the entrance that you can see everything inside.\nWe were greeted but after some time , at first we were not sure if we should sit ourselves. In the end we got someone who took us to the table.\nWe ordered the drinks and the food and waited about 10 minutes to get the drinks. They bring you water at the beginning, you have to ask for a straw if you need it, as they don't just bring them together.\nThe food came after 15-20 minutes...not bad. We got the Hawaiian Swordfish Taco and The Organic Chicken. Both were good, however, the chicken was not cooked properly as we could see the pink in the meat . I'll attach a picture. It was a little spicy and you could taste the smoke ... good taste though.\nI was pretty disappointed as I was expecting a better service for the price we paid. The server was just simply serving, nothing special like you'd expect from a place who serves food on the expensive side. It was just average...took the order, came to check if all was good and then brought the check. We should have said something about the poorly cooked chicken but we didn't , we did not know till we got to cut it.\nIn conclusion, it's a nice place for the atmosphere and less for the food or service. You also don't have many choices on the menu. Since I don't have the option , my rate would be 3.5 stars."", 'Zach, our server was the best. Out first time here he guided us through the menus, both brunch and dinner. So much to choose from. We landed on bacon deviled eggs to start. Then short rib hash with eggs for me and a pork/chili eggs Benedict. Topped off with a great basil gimlet and Bloody Mary. Great experience.', 'We had a lovely meal on the patio. The server was excellent and funny and everyone loved their meal. I had the Ethan veggie plate which was all the more delicious as we shared the meal with the namesake of the dish!']"

First time in Phoenix and wanted something easy, close, high energy vibe and good food - 5/5 for all these at Culinary Dropout! We had 5 drinks, 3 apps,  1 salads, 3 entrees and 1 dessert.

It had too much sweet and sour, she could not fish the drink. I do recommend the fried chicken and buttermilk biscuit. At first it look burn on the outside but it was moist and tender on the inside, the biscuit was not dry at all the mash potatoes were delicious.', ""I just have to say, this place is absolutely amazing! We originally had a reservation at another spot across town, but the staff here went above and beyond to squeeze our family in for my daughter's cheers competition celebration. Our server, Nancy, was an absolute rockstar! She was super attentive and friendly, and she even helped out by charging my wife's phone.\n\nThe food? Oh man, it was top-notch! We devoured the fried shrimp appetizer in like a minute - even the kids loved it! I went for the fried chicken, the wife got the kale salad, and the kids enjoyed their chicken nuggets and cheeseburger meals.

The Vig,4.4,2814,"[""Absolutely loved my lunch date here. The office ladies came here, and it was a  delightful experience. The atmosphere is such a nice touch, low lighting, decor, and dark colors, I appreciated it all. The food was good, especially the truffle fries. I've been on a French dip sandwich kick lately, and I wasn't really impressed with mine here, but it wasn't bad at all. I may prefer stronger flavors than most. The team really enjoyed their meals and  I would love to come back after work for some drinks."", 'GREAT date night place. Atmosphere, venue, service - all high-quality. Unfortunately, they did not have many gluten free options so we ended up just having drinks - so I cannot speak to their food quality but the small menu did seem to consist of some decent choices for those without dietary restrictions.\n\nThe drinks were well-prepared and hit the spot perfectly!', 'Ordered drinks and the hummus as an appetizer. We had the steak salad and shrimp and crab enchiladas. Everything was delicious. Only thing that could be improved was service. Waiter was polite enough but likely had too many tables. We went awhile with no water refills. Overall, I’d go back again.', ""First and last time.\n\nFor the price of food, it should've tasted way better. Medium rare French dip wasn't. Not much of it for $25 and had small pieces that fell out if I wanted to dip in jus.  I know what the fish tasted like the table next to us ordered because the smell was so strong, I felt it down my nose and throat. Burgers other ordered at our table looked great. Steak frites were pushing definition of medium well and pretty fatty. Since steak is cut, it would've been nice to have that at least removed before sending out. Table next to us was a group also. It felt very tight and not comfortable enough to really enjoy our meal.\n\nThe service was great. Our group was very well attended and had no problems with our orders or who ordered what.\nIt was a very mixed reaction we all felt but imo, the price of the food doesn't justify ever going back. Not worth the cost or hassle of parking.\n\nEdit to add:\nHi Jules, I appreciate the response, but as previously stated, I don't plan on going back. But thank you."", ""It was my first time visiting this location with some family right before catching a baseball game downtown, so we decided to go for a bite here and I have to say was quite impressed overall with my experience here for the first time. The service was great and atmosphere here was very nice and relaxing, food was good as well I had the turkey pastrami sandwich with gluten free bread and some sweet potato fries on the side. Overall positive experience and would recommend to anyone. On the side note, I parked in front of the restaurant, it is paid parking for other spots walking distance but it's like that anywhere downtown, so just a fyi for anyone curious.""]"

The hash brown was crispy and flavorful, the eggs were seasoned well and the avocado toast was very flavorful.\nI would recommend this place for a good breakfast.', ""Huge restaurant serving huge portions of delicious food.  There are numerous places to dine both inside and out with  separate bar areas.  The cocktails are very good.  The baked pasta dish was bit heavy on the hot spice but still delicious.  Don't miss out on the eggplant meatballs!"", 'This was a surprise treat! Had a group of colleagues in town for the week and this place was booked for one of our evening dinners. I had never heard of this place and had no preconceived ideas about it.\n\nWow, ambiance and layout really kind of blew me away. Walking through the front it seemed like a nice, fancy restaurant but then we walked through the main floor and out into the yard and the place grew by 10x. Really unexpected but very welcomed as the weather was beautiful to sit outside. There is a separate bar building on the grounds which is also unique. There are even random cats that mosey on through the grounds Great atmosphere.\n\nThe food. Well the most surprising dish was the eggplant meatballs. They were fantastic and the polenta they were served with was rich and creamy like mashed potatoes but better. I think the group ended up ordering 5 plates of these things. Really a must try!\n\nOn the other hand, a colleague and I split the ribs for dinner and that left much to desire. First of all, they are huge and make a really great presentation. They look like dinosaur ribs but from there, it kind of falls short. The where charred which can be good but you get a lot of char taste with it which is overpowering. The worst part was the amount of fat on these ribs barely left any meat for you to enjoy. When you did get a bite, it was good but felt there was more picking away the fat than there was time to enjoy the meat. A let down for the price they are charging.\n\nOverall, really cool place with unique food options and a great atmosphere. Just make sure the food is cooked well and I would go back again for sure.']"

My only issue is that it advertises its beautiful scenery, but it looked like the hotel guests had the best seating. My daughter booked a table several weeks earlier and mentioned it was my 60th birthday, and our table overlooked the parking lot and other tables in front of us. Our reservation was for 15 minutes before opening, and the room was filled, so I'm assuming hotel guests were seated with the best seats first. Of course, that's okay, but they should mention that when advertising or accepting reservations, as I'm sure like us, many people book for the scenery. Would we go again? No. But it was worth a try. And we were able to walk outside after dinner for some stunning photos♡"", 'We stopped by the Terrace Room to have drinks before heading to our dinner reservations.

Love the fact that the restaurant has waiting area where you can have a free soft drink or water while you’re waiting for your reserved table.   Unfortunately the tartar appetizer was too salty and my main dish Salmon was a on the salty side as well… other than that, the other dishes are fresh and commendable, especially the fresh shrimp cocktail and Mediterranean seabass!

We ordered the chicken Parmesan with spicy sauce and artichoke Bianca pizza. The chicken Parmesan had excellent flavor and was complimented nicely with the side of pasta that tasted fresh. The artichoke Bianca pizza was also a nice surprise and not what either of us were expecting in terms of flavor in a good way. We topped it off with some tiramisu. What a light and flavorful dessert that topped off a fine dining experience. We had to get some cannolis for the road after hearing great reviews about them and they also did not disappoint.

With a bar section, a dining section, and outdoor dining as well, there's a little something for everyone here. The service was amazing! I wish I could remember the young lady's name that served my wife and I. She was everything you would expect from a five-star restaurant. All the employees there seem to be enjoying themselves and happy to be working. This is another rare site nowadays. The menu was full of delicious choices to make. I wish I could remember all that was in there but I was really there for the barbecue. I decided to go with beef ribs and glad I did as The meat literally fell off the bone and I enjoyed every bite of it. We have been looking for a new barbecue place and I believe we've found it!

The off-menu cocktail was by far my favorite - one of the best I had. So good. Hearts on Fire was balanced and refreshing. My husband said his IPA was one of the favorites he has had (and we are from Portland), but his Old Fashioned was a little weak for him, which is more personal preference.\nFood: Soy Watermelon - super refreshing, great palate cleanser to start the meal. Fried Green Tomato + Burrata - I love anything with burrata and this was so good, the calabrian chili marmalade put it over the top.

STRONG horse radish, which I absolutely adored.  The live music was amazing.  The ambiance was very cowboy/ranch -- reflected in the music.

I got the Rustlers cut, and it was cooked perfectly to my requested medium well. The flavor of the beef was good. Came with extremely plain carrots and corn on the cob. My fully dressed baked potato was also very regular tasting with not much flavor. Our starter potato skins were done well and tasty. I also enjoyed their hot biscuits with cinnamon butter.

A huge waffle with a huge perfectly cooked and juicy pork chop on top and eggs anyway you want them topped on top of the pork chop and a Portuguese donut on the side. I got the Mexican Benedict which was great I love the idea of it coming on a sopé rather than an English muffin along with chorizo! We also both ordered the ""Flight o\' "" which is 3 samplers of Japanese cold brew. Flavors vary, but we got a black and tan, a green tea with mint, and a star anise and cardamom.

Stuffed mushrooms were great but very small. Veal was a bit dry, but scallops and lobster were cooked well, just a bit bland. Could really use more flavor. The filet was not terrible but could\'ve been better. It was bland and a bit tough. Creamy risotto was nice. But we\'ve had worse, and we\'re montanans, so we are picky about our meat.

I don\'t normally repeat restaurants on the same trip, but this one was so good - I needed to return! The menu is very unique, but not so unique that it doesn\'t have something for everyone. The nightly dinner specials were also very impressive. Each night I had a three course dinner, and enjoyed everything. I loved the strawberry shortcake dessert so much I had it both nights in a row. Staff are very attentive and accommodating. I don\'t drink alcohol and the staff and bartender went above and beyond to make me some excellent alcohol free cocktails.

I always underestimate the portion sizes of the sides that come with the dishes but overall, the place was clean and definitely an experience. The service was amazing but I couldn’t help but feel that our server wasn’t very genuine in serving us. Don’t get me wrong, they were amazing, very knowledgeable, and had very little to no errors but it felt very choregraphed and I couldn’t help but feel that the server would rather be somewhere else.

The real star of this show was the sticky toffee pudding, though. It's genuinely top 5 desserts I've ever had in my life. It was so warm and moist and the oven gives it such a sweet char taste it was just marvelous. I'd show up just for a drink and some toffee pudding.

We also ordered lemonade, which tasted fantastic. Half of the dining area upstairs seemed to be under construction because there was a large black plastic sheet covering one wall.

The chicken was nice and tender.\n\nThe sides of mashed potatoes, white gravy, and buttered corn are fantastic as well.\n\nThe waitstaff are kind and caring.\n\nBoth times I went around 5-6PM.\n\nI will be going again ASAP.', ""I loved the atmosphere, very eclectic.  I ordered the pork chop, seasoned and grilled. I've made better at home. It was very bland, had no seasoning at all and I only requested that they lightly use pepper. My friend however, got the cheeseburger and it  looked great. He said it was very good. You can tell by looking at it the patty was fresh and not frozen.\nWe both felt the prices were a bit high for everything. I mean $25 for chicken fried steak, in my opinion was high even if you get 2 patties.\nI'll give it another go, I'll just be getting the cheeseburger."", 'A very cool place to visit!\nThe decoration is super cool with all of the lights and photos on the walls.\nService and staff are friendly.

Rusconi's American Kitchen,4.7,690,"[""I've been coming here for almost a dozen years. The food never disappoints. Some of the servers come and go but some faces stay the same. Fritz will always be my favorite, and even when I don't get sat in his section, it makes me happy when he pretends like he remembers us. Some dishes change with the seasons, some stay year round because they're just amazing. The chef is meticulous with staging every dish that comes out and the taste is always on par with the aesthetic. We went for restaurant week this time and all the dishes were delicious. Even sitting next to a very loud annoying group couldn't ruin the enjoyment of my meal."", ""My friend and I dined here on a Thursday evening. This first visit was fabulous. We ordered drinks and loved them. Curtis was our server. He made us feel welcome and anticipating the entire evening ahead. The chef sent over a tasty treat to start off our first visit and my birthday.  Light and fresh. Next we tried the Heirloom Tomato salad. Perfection and bites if on the menu you dine do not miss the opportunity. Basil sorbet tops off the tomato!! My friend ordered the Filet over Pea Risotto instead of mac and cheese on the menu. I ordered the Blackberry Glaze on Pork Tenderloin with fingerling potatoes.  Every bite was tremendous. Dessert was next and we were going to try two. Dark Chocolate Bread Pudding is a Do Not Miss!! Next we tried the Jar of the Moment which this evening was banana pudding and salted Carmel.  This was the best dining evening I have ever experienced.  Absolutely we will return!!! This restaurant will keep me dreaming of my next visit to Phoenix and I know where I am going first!!! Do not miss this BEST Ever dining experience.\n\nI would be remiss if I did not mention this menu is extremely reasonably priced which makes the dining experience even more impressive. Stampede to get a reservation here you won't ever be disappointed!"", 'This restaurant is one of our Phoenix/Scottsdale go-tos.  The food is always creative, well prepared, and well served.

Rusconi’s did not disappoint—our experience was amazing from start to finish.\n\nUpon arrival, we were greeted warmly and shown to a nicely secluded table for two, complete with an anniversary card. This personal touch immediately set the tone for a special evening.\n\nOur waiter, Fritz, was an absolute professional. He has a great personality and an impressive knowledge of the menu. Although we had reviewed the menu online at home and thought we knew what we wanted to order, Fritz's detailed presentation of the specials convinced us to change our minds.\n\nI started the evening with a celebratory Meyer Lemon Martini with rosemary—simply wow. My husband enjoyed an Aperol spritzer. To our delight, the chef came out with an amuse-bouche of shrimp after learning it was our first visit to Rusconi’s, adding a delightful touch to our dining experience.\n\nFor appetizers, Fritz's descriptions were so enticing that we chose the special squash blossoms and a tomato burrata salad with basil sorbet. Both dishes were exceptional. For our main courses, I ordered the osso bucco special, while my husband opted for the short ribs. Both were cooked to perfection and absolutely delectable. We ended our meal with a blueberry cheesecake for dessert, which was the perfect sweet finish to a wonderful meal.\n\nThe ambiance and staff at Rusconi’s really make the place welcoming. Prices were extremely reasonable, with cocktails at $15 and appetizers at $14. Main courses ranged from $18 to $38, and the restaurant boasts a wonderful wine list.\n\nTo top it all off, we received a phone call the next day thanking us for our visit and expressing the hope that we would return. Such thoughtful follow-up truly reflects their commitment to exceptional customer service.\n\nWe will definitely be returning to Rusconi’s American Kitchen. This restaurant made our anniversary celebration unforgettable, and we highly recommend it to anyone looking for a special dining experience."", 'My family came for brunch and the food was great. Deliciously well done, nice and warm when it arrived to the table. The drinks were also made well. The service was good as well, everyone was nice and personable. I highly recommend and I cannot wait to come back and try their dinner menu.']"
Tarbell's,4.6,620,"['I can see why Tarbells has been an institution on Camelback for so many years.\n\nWhen we stepped in, we were professionally greeted and ushered to our reserved table for 2 immediately.\n\nAppetizer was the House Cured Bacon Candy Salad. Fantastic. Great balance of savory, salty, and sweet. And best of all, because they knew we were splitting it, they split it nicely and ensured each of us received a gorgeous poached egg on top.\n\nEntrees were the Moon River Ranch Ribeye (cooked to perfection) and the hand cut ribbon pasta (very, very good) and a pizza (which we knew we couldn’t finish but we really wanted to, it was so good).\n\nDessert was the chocolate mousse. Velvety and sumptuous. And they comped it (not sure why, because there was zero service issues) In fact, service was efficient and friendly.\n\nDrinks were also pretty good. All in all, a great meal and no surprise that Tarbells has been around so many years. Already thinking about the next reservation.', ""Spectacular dining experience.   Our friends in Phoenix suggested Tarbell's, and we are so glad.  They have a small private dining room which h sears 6 comfortably.   Our friends know Mark.  The wine list is great.

Overall a fine dining experience."", 'My husband brought me here for our anniversary and it was such a beautiful experience. All of the staff was very attentive and kind. Our waters never got even remotely empty. We had personalized recommendations for wine. Thorough explanation of specials and the menu in general. Our starters came out in a timely fashion as well as the main courses. Meanwhile we had yummy bread and oil with herbs to snack on.\nI had a white wine paired with the organic local greens as a starter (10/10) and the grilled organic Scottish salmon for the entree (8.5/10) - I wasn’t a huge fan of the saffron but it’s a personal flavor type thing for me. The salmon itself was cooked perfectly. My husband gives the same dish a 10/10. Everything was beautifully presented. Then, at the end of the night Mark Tarbell himself thanked us for coming and the hostesses wishes us a happy anniversary. It was an amazing experience. So happy to have come here. Thank you to the entire staff. You all are amazing. 🤎', 'Very good upscale restaurant with unique offerings and extensive wine menu. The staff were very courteous. Our server had a nice personality without being over the top. All our food was delicious and the cheesecake is something special ( topped with rosemary salted caramel). The tables are a little close together for my liking in this type environment. Overall very pleased.', 'The restaurant allows guests to hand-select the wine from the wine store to drink at the restaurant.     The staffs were very friendly. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and can definitely help you pick your favorite wine within your budget.\n\nI would recommend you to try the pan seared chicken. The sauce complements very well with the juicy chicken.']"

Service was professional, well mannered, and attentive. But the food..... was fabulous! I had originally ordered the lunch short rib gnocchi, but it was sold out. I can totally understand why such a combination would sell out. I ended up with the shrimp that was in a garlic jalapeno butter sauce atop a coconut rice with veggies. The taste, texture, temperature, and serving size were all perfect! Stop in and experience a local favorite!', ""I liked the atmosphere but the food wasn't that great! We had the weekend menu for $44 a piece! My fish was a bit cold when it got to the table. The salad dressing was only pomegranate molasses! Finally the soda was flat!

It would be nice to have room temp butter for the corn bread because the cold butter doesn’t spread. The red chile pork had great flavor. I enjoyed my Grille’s old fashioned but my husband wasn’t impressed with his margarita. The server was friendly.', 'This place is a must visit if you haven’t already. Everything on the menu is great. The food is always fresh, and I love the salmon. The atmosphere is nice and customer service is top notch. Parking is a little tight, but if you park on the side of the building, there are additional spaces. Other than that this place is a hidden gem.', 'What an unsuspecting gem. Try the restaurants that are an acronym is the lesson. We sat on the patio and were quickly waited on. The inside was bustling with all types of clientele. The cornbread was a scrumptious buttery surprise and the beef short rib was on point. Not what you’d expect from a restaurant in a shopping center strip. Amazing and highly recommend!']"

My experience began with a perfectly crafted mezcal Negroni, setting the tone for the evening. The Heirloom Tomato Tartine appetizer, featuring fennel, gorgonzola crème, and fig vinaigrette, was a delightful start. For the main course, the Grilled Swordfish, paired with fermented tomato gazpacho, cucumber, and salsa verde, was a highlight.

The attitude was one of us being an inconvenience for giving them our business!

Potatoes were ok, tho not seasoned heavily and the beans were like ranch beans but didn't have much flavor.\n\nWife said flavor / seasonings were missing from her skewers too.

The Compass,4.2,1350,"[""Fantastic restaurant. I like to visit location-unique restaurants for my birthday. The Compass did not disappoint.\n\nThe seafood was cooked to perfection. It was not rubbery or tough. The rose package was a nice touch (thanks, sis), and for romantic events, I watched staff spread roses on the table.\n\nIf you've not been before, the waitstaff have their hometown on their name tags. I found it to be a nice touch, and it sparked conversation.\n\nTheir seating can cater to many tastes. There are tables of various sizes and curved high tables along the edge for an even better view.\n\nI decided on the Yes Chef! The server will check for allergen and preferences, but the 👨\u200d🍳/👩\u200d🍳 makes for choices for you. If you're adventurous and it's your first time, that is what I suggest. The paradox of choice can't slow you down.\n\nNote: The sauce that comes with the muscles is amazing. Just ask for extra bread if you know you're ordering it."", 'We were so disappointed. It’s been a while since we were there. This was for my birthday dinner. Unfortunately, the service was terrible and so was the food. There’s no bread service available so while we were sitting for 15 minutes after being seated, without service, there was nothing you could eat. Or drink. They were out of carpaccio so we ordered calamari, which clearly came from the frozen section at Costco. Overcooked and had that pre-breaded frozen gooey texture under the overcooked exterior.  Then the salads. A panzanella salad should be crispy chunks of shredded freshly fried bread croutons and tomatoes. I had exactly three croutons on mine and they were nowhere close to fresh. The red tomatoes on it were literally rotting and mushy. The yellow ones were fine. The salad was generally tasteless apart from the rotting tomato taste. My companion had the house salad. It had rotting lettuce leaves in it. Also tasteless. Then our main dishes were both pasta. Kid you not, we waited a half hour after our salads were taken away and still no food. Wait person had no answer on the delay. The restaurant was not crowded. Finally told them to forget it we were leaving. We went to Taco Boys instead for both better food and service. Btw Hyatt charges $20 for reservations in the first place.', 'What an incredible space you have all curated : from the glamorous hostess gliding us to our seats to the kind hearted and fun server, Monica. She genuinely cared for us as we rambled on about our wedding this year and choosing our wedding bands and to our surprise there was a beautiful white vase of fresh red roses. As a started we had the seasonal toast which was complimentary to the champagne we ordered.\nWe shared everything and loved the Panzanella salad and its circular presentation. So smart. The risotto was wonderful and creamy. The winter salad with its beet chips was also special as they paired it with a light vinaigrette. The blueberry puff pastry as a desert is exquisite as no one really does blueberries in deserts right now and combining it with a chocolate soufflé and cold vanilla ice cream is a beautiful combination. This restaurant is from 1976 and was once a Playboy Club complete with conversation pits that were sadly covered up with new flooring. But the compass era of this space still very much rotates and being born in the 1970s I find this so very special.

Thank you Monica : you are absolutely wonderful.  We shall be back', ""This is a great place for a special occasion. The food itself is very good but not excellent for the price. You pay for the view and experience, but their food was better than expected given the reviews. We liked the filet, but it won't leave any memories. The scallop pasta was the best main dish we tried. Our desserts were both delicious."", ""We celebrated our anniversary here. We came here years ago and have been here a few times.  They remodeled the inside to a more modern, sleek style. We had a reservation and had to pay extra to guarantee a spot next to the window, which does not go towards your bill. You can also choose other add-ons like flowers or wine. I will say I put down that we were celebrating our anniversary, and our server didn't even know. They seemed slightly short staffed for a Saturday. The service was lacking in comparison to when we were here last. They used to offer corn bread or other complimentary bread, which they stopped doing. The experience was still nice but not as romantic as it used to be.\n\nThe food and drinks were still amazing. I will say it was just as good as we remember. We got scallops and the sea bass, and the seasoning and preparation were very well done. The cocktails were also well made, so there are no complaints there just kudos to the chef and kitchen staff. The appetizer we started with was the octopus, and it also was cooked nicely with a good presentation. I think the food is the redeeming quality here in addition to the views.\n\nI will say the lighting distracts away from the view. Sometimes, the lighting will change to bright to a slight dim, but I think it should be a more warmer lighting that would allow for better views at night. I would recommend coming when the sun is going down to get the full experience. Just ask Google.\n\nWe still would return for the food and views and would recommend it.

It's a fun, special thing to treat yourself to once in a while.\n\nThe employees here are always happy, kind, professional and informative about the menu. My server tonight told me that there is a Thursday night special this summer on $30 bottles of wine. They also have a bottomless coupe special as a Saturday tea add-on.\n\nThe vibe here is like coming home, to a good home with loving relatives who cook great food.""]"

Salad was good, but dressing was a little odd for me with mustard in it. I am a Veal fan. The Veal was amazing but the overall flavor of the Veal Parm was a little bland. We really like the atmosphere. It was elegant but had that Cheers feel. Service was 5 star. We will go back.', 'This was our first time in Phoenix and in this restaurant.We had an enjoyable dinner. Portions are large and our linguine with white clam sauce was very tasty. All main dishes come with a small cup of soup and a salad.

Before the pizza came I though I would be too full but, when the pizza came I couldn’t help myself ! The crust was perfect!  Thin and crispy with delish and unique toppings. If you are looking for a thick.greasy pepperoni pizza this is not the pizza for you, but they also have pasta dishes and yummy salads!

They had a blueberry sour beer on tap as their special, which was a nice surprise.  The cocktails are pretty basic, but it's cool they make their own fruit punch and ginger beer.

My dad said the gravy reminded him of the restaurant in his home town.\n\nThe chicken biscuit sandwich was juicy, tender, and gone after about 5 minutes of arriving. My dad got the chicken fried steak and it was one if the better versions I've had.\n\nThe biscuit has to be the best I've had. They butter and toast it like bread and its a game changer.

The cauliflower burrito was a real highlight—it was perfectly roasted, with a smoky, slightly spicy flavor that balanced well with the fresh veggies. The wrap was soft and fresh, and every bite was packed with flavor. As for the tacos, they were equally impressive. The fillings were vibrant and flavorful, with well-seasoned veggies, fresh salsa, and just the right amount of heat.\n\nThe portion sizes were generous, and the presentation was beautiful.

Which I’m usually someone who can eat most food and be excited but we ordered the plantain appetizer, pork chop, side of corn and a steak and for the price, it didn’t wow our table. The pork chop was overcooked and lacked any flavor. The plantain appetizer was soggy. The corn didn’t seem like it was cooked at all- more like microwaved and arrived a bit on the cold side. We went for my birthday and they didn’t acknowledge our celebration which was kind of a bummer and we honestly felt overlooked by our server but again, could have been an off night for them.\n\nThe atmosphere and decor.. is out of a magazine and seriously incredible.

What a wonderful experience & stunning restaurant inside the JW Marriott Desert Ridge! We had the mercado experience. So many options to choose from~ all very fresh and flavorful! From sweet to savory, they had it all! There was an older gentleman there that was so sweet, thank you for making us laugh! Looking forward to next time!', 'A fantastic deal for a flavorful journey through the sprawling breakfast buffet. From avocado toast, to birria tacos. Husband loved the plantains the most, which came prepared like a breakfast potato. Their house made salsas - whoa! Chefs kiss. The muffin tops, coffee and yogurt were a nice light touch.

Asada fries were ok."", 'Good food, the one mistake they made with me, I feel,  was not letting me have the baked potato I asked for with my entree. They basically told me to have their green chili potatoes, as if to letting me know in their opinion indirectly that I was not worthy, because that’s how I felt as they told me this right in front of a business associate I have not seen for over 7 years who was making efforts to making a special moment for me, and bluntly told me that it was because they didn’t have any baked potatoes made and only basically make baked potatoes to the evening crowd which when I left it was the typical type entitled type who they considered as “worthy customers.” I felt this was very abruptly rude, when waiters and waitresses know the code especially about how to always make a customer feel comfortable, happy, and especially worthy with the type of money that we have to spend when we go out to eat, as it is, you would think that this basic courtesy would have been taken into consideration , It’s places that hire people like this that allow their heads to getting way too big and that set the tone of what the state of Arizona truly promotes and keeps alive. It sure isn’t equality, and or love in most cases that I have experienced here. Unfortunately. This is what will and always will hold this beautiful scenic state behind politically, and socially speaking. I don’t like when people do this to me when I hardly go out to eat for this reason of many failures. But I did like the way the food tasted.

I have been there for dinner, brunch and happy hour, always great food! Their brunch is amazing, large portions, great prices!

Persepshen,4.6,315,"[""I'm absolutely appalled at what we just encountered at this restaurant. We walked in to have a light appetizer before we didn't escape the room and sat at the bar. We ordered the mussels. Chef recommended a iced tea to go along with our meal. On first impression, what we realized is that the chef was making all of the food bare hands. Without washing in between touching other items in the kitchen, including our drinks. I saw a staff member remove a customer's food from the oven. Some kind of chicken dish with chicken pieces on top of it and with his bare hands picked up a piece of chicken that fell either on the counter or in the oven and put it back on the customer's plate. Either on the counter or in the oven and put it back on the customer's plate the chef then with his bare hands, dressed the plate with various food items and handed this to the customer. When we received our muscles, I immediately smelled a fishy smell that would last the entire meal. The sauce which was described to us as delicious and almost drinkable was average at best. The broth was uneventful and tasted sour. Again, the mussels smelled like fish immediately turned my stomach and we did not finish the meal. The bread was stale and the overall experience just left us with an absolute foul taste in our mouth and concern for whether or not we are going to get sick from eating mussels. That were not fresh. the muscles tasted almost as if they had sand in them. to top all this off we walked out spending over $40. Mussels themselves were $28. I'm just absolutely dumbfounded. This used and so we've been in this building before and so what I will say positive about this experience is that they have done a really good job in changing the building over to a new restaurant. The aesthetic is flawless. The food and the service based around the serving of food is an absolute disgrace. Hard pass."", 'We went here for the first time tonight and were absolutely wow-ed. Every single item we ordered was cooked perfectly and was in the running for the best food we’ve ever had. It was money well spent and we’re already planning our next visit in.', 'Make sure to visit place before the end of strawberry season. I was already pretty well full but decided to try the “Fresas” anyway. Local, organic strawberries are hard to pass up, no matter the stomach’s current over-occupation. It was a beautiful dish, in every way. The praline pecans won’t be what you’re expecting; they’re soft and crumbly - delicate. The strawberries are like ones you’d grow in your own garden - small, juicy, slightly tart, and very red. The crème fraîche is mild and velvety, perfectly complimenting the other flavors/textures. It was adorned with flower petals - just gorgeous. Every once in awhile I find a dish that’s inspired; this was one of those. Perfection.\n\nThe dishes here, from what I tried, are very flavor forward; you won’t find something under seasoned - this chef is very bold. If you have a sensitive palate, I recommend ordering sauces on the side, just in case.\n\nI ate quite a bit: half of two appetizers, the steak and potatoes, and half the Fresas; our motto of the night must’ve been “no food left behind.” No doggy bag necessary. The odd thing was I never felt uncomfortable, no matter how many bites over the limit I went. Perhaps, the quality of the ingredients granted me a stay of tummy troubles.\n\nHope to visit again very soon!', 'Went for my bday.  Our waiter was the worst I have ever experienced, condescending, rude & told us we had to order everything at once (which we didn’t).  Wanted to love the food, but my husband’s burger was cold & raw.  The waiter argued that this was the dry-aged beef & gave us attitude.    My son had the scallop padella & it was salty & some bites were bitter.   The rice had to be pre-cooked because it was served about 5-min after ordering.   I love the concept & really hope that they can do better in the future.  This particular waiter needs to find another profession - I felt that we entered Hell’s Kitchen.  On the bright side, the hostess was very nice & attentive.  My drink was very good.', 'So good!! Everything we ordered was delicious but our favorites were pork chop and scallops. It was hard to decide what to get because everything on the menu looked amazing. Can’t wait to go back and try more things.

I regret not ordering dessert (I couldn't, or I would have had to roll myself out since the portion sizes are family style and generous), but each item on the dessert menu sounded like it needed to be in my belly. I will most definitely visit again. Our server, Ryan, was knowledgeable, kind, and attentive. The atmosphere and interior design are very cool.

Wine menu was decent , they have an open kitchen concept facing a wide bar which offers seating and same menu as well.

It was my husband and I's first time in Phoenix and this was one of the places I was most excited to visit. First, let me begin by stating the restaurant itself was beautiful and extremely vibey. The hostess was friendly and the live music was amazing. The wait time between our appetizers and the main course was a bit longer than I would have liked.  As for the food, I was a bit disappointed in the flavors. I’m from the Caribbean, and for this establishment to advertise as pan-African cuisine the flavors were lacking for me. I had the sorrel-ginger drink which was not very authentic to me being from the islands. I have had much better, even from other West African restaurants I’ve visited. I had the shrimp escabeche, and my husband had the piri piri wings as our appetizers, both were delicious. The appetizers stole the show for me and made up for the lack of flavors in the main dishes. I had the Dayboat Moqueca (salmon), while my husband had the smoked awaze chicken. Both dishes lacked the “authentic” flavors of Pan Africa. I understand being an upscale establishment, but a little more seasoning would have enhanced the flavors. I'm unsure whose taste palettes the chef was catering to, but it certainly didn’t seem to be anything my fellow Caribbean and African counterparts would be proud of. Overall the experience was good, I just wish the chef would have allowed the ancestors to guide them with the flavors a bit more."", ""We came here for estaurant week and really enjoyed the experience.  We each ordered different items from the three course menu and were able to try a variety of dishes.  You should try the southern pound cake for dessert as it's amazing.\n\nThe decor was very unique and had a historic look and feel to it which we liked.  The live music added to the ambiance without being tool loud or overwhelming.\n\nThe restaurant is located in the downtown PHX area, so parking can be a little tricky.  There is a valet option in front of the restaurant that charges $15 for parking.  The attendant seemed a little overwhelmed trying to handle all of the people wanting to park there.""]"
the larder & the delta,4.4,286,"['Date night at this place and it was so special! Rich southern food! Restaurant has cool artwork and open to the outside with patio seating. Would recommend the chicken skins appetizer, catfish and cauliflower dish and the hoppin John (especially if you like southern food). I wish there was a bigger cocktail menu to go with all the delicious dishes! And our side dish came out before our entree but everything is made to order so the timing of that made it come out later. Would definitely recommend for a date night or even a night out with friends, casual dining with elevated dishes.', 'Came here for the AZ restaurant week after we were impressed by the Super Bowl wings picked up order. The staffs and the chefs were very friendly. They also mentioned that they changed the menu very frequent to showcase the Southern cuisine. There are the patio seatings available.\n\nFor the restaurant week menu, fried chicken skin was my favorite. It was crispy and well seasoned. However, Berkshire pork chop and Ethiopian fried chicken were a bit too dried.\n\nI might come back here again for the rotating menu.', ""This place has been on my Phoenix Foodie Bucket List for years now, and I finally got a chance to go. I absolutely LOVED my meal at the Larder + the Delta. We went just before the Beyonce concert and it was such a good, filling meal to have before dancing the night away. The staff was so friendly and very quick to assist. I LOVED the fried chicken skins. It was covered in a slight glaze of orange, lavender type of honey. I also had the gulf shrimp and grits, and it was amazing. The shrimp was a nice big size, the grits were creamy, and the hot sauce was a perfect blend of spice and flavor. My friend had the Blackened Mississippi Catfish, but I didn't take pictures of it - though it was very good (I snuck a bite). And we also had the Hot Water Corn Bread with a whipped honey butter. At first, I thought by the look of it and the first bite, it was kinda shortbread-ish but it was just a perfectly, non-messy consistency/not crumby but still crumbly (if that makes sense). It was very, very good and the whipped butter was not overwhelmingly sweet - just the perfect complement to the corn bread. The ambiance was clean and chill. Just a lovely time at this restaurant and would highly recommend.\n\nI will say that the parking might be a bit difficult to find because you are in downtown Phoenix where it's limited to street parking or valet, so highly recommend Uber or rideshare for convenience of getting in and out."", ""I stayed overnight at the FoundRE last time I had a commitment in Phoenix.  I picked the hotel because of it's proximity to the larder + the delta. Yes, it's that amazing, a must stop when I have an evening in Phoenix.  Make a reservation if you can, if not you may be able to grab an open spot on the patio.  The menu is updated frequently,  the hoppin jon was the best version of this dish I've ever had!! Shrimp and Grits also a must,  the Gumbo (of course). Go, just go,  whatever you order you'll dream about until the next time you return.  😁"", ""More delicious than ever. Love the new Portland on the Park location! Chef Jones is a master with southern food. You have to order the hot chicken/biscuits and the cauliflower, at least. The prices will let you taste a lot of things. I don't know how they make the chicken so tender and crispy. Bravo! Full bar and open for Sunday brunch too.""]"

This is the first steak that I would put above Dominick's, and that's saying a lot. The quail egg with the bearnaise sauce to accompany the steak was just perfect. I don't usually like anything on my steak when it's prepared well, but this addition was delectable.\n\nThey have put effort into making this into an experience, with little surprises and Easter eggs to discover throughout the meal, similar to Alinea. I get the sense that they are still developing these ideas, and will perhaps continue to expand upon this. I always appreciate when there are little things to turn the meal into more of an event.\n\nThe food speaks for itself. My photos don't do it justice, particularly with the low light, but suffice it to say that it was worth the price.

Otherwise...cool place ,decent vibe and good food.', 'Visited on Wednesday night and it was extremely crowded and I’m assuming this was due to most of the attendees from our work conference was here. The space is too dark- so much so, you can barely see the menu. People were using their phone lights to try and view the menu. The lighting needs to be adjusted, folks need to see what they are ordering and see their food once it comes out. The restaurant was extremely busy so we barely saw our waiter which made for a challenging experience as one person in our party did not have any utensils and had to grab one from the bar. I ordered the calamari and the mushroom garlic noodles. The calamari was fried perfectly and not heavily coated. The marinara sauce was delicious and you could tell it was homemade. The mushroom noodles was not bad- a tad bit oily and it seems as if too much truffle oil was used as it became a bit overpowering as the oil settled. I would order both dishes again but ask them for less oil.', 'As an avid restaurant reviewer, i have to say this restaurant is currently one of my top favorites because the food here is absolutely scrumptious!

I was told some of the cooling equipment was down and it would take thousands of dollars to fix it.  So they switch around which beers to keep colder.  I had the Mediterranean Salmon.  Salmon was very tasty, could have been cooked just a little less.  I wasn't too keen on the bed of cauliflower rice mixture but that's probably just me.  I did love the grilled half of lemon.

Condiments were necessary but did not help. I'm used to restaurants without salt and pepper at the table, but in turn, i expect the food delicious as prepared in the kitchen.

The hummus here was thick, exceedingly smooth, and forceful. I savored every spoonful.\n\nFunnily enough, the famed lamb shoulder was one of the weaker dishes. It was not gamey at all, fork-tender, but a bit dry and bland. I enjoyed the bean stew that came with it a good deal more.

Not even close.', 'Truly a dinner that left everyone speechless. We opted for their ‘Mesibah’ which had their infamous lamb that has been on the menu since first opening. Their seasonal summer course had fresh fruits with cheeses - halloumi paired with ripe summer peaches, red cherries with succulent snap peas and aged parmesan or blueberries with feta and corn were all ingenious, fresh and full-flavoured. The lamb shoulder was the showstopper, the perfect centrepiece to our table, fall-apart tender meat, bursting with savoury robust lamb flavours. The pomegranate sauce coated the lamb with a lustrous gleam and completely took the edge off the gaminess. Pairing everything with the crispy Persian rice made this such a phenomenal bite, we didn’t know food could taste this good.

The four course tasting menu included so many different foods, with some extras given to us complimentary. I did the wine pairing and was able to change it up based on my preference.

The potatoes were a bit too crispy for me, I would not get those. I had the chaser salad too which I think I would have enjoyed more without the balsamic. My husband had simple eggs and bacon with potatoes. He said it was good. My brother had an omelet and grits. The omelet wasn't made how we typically like it, with everything mixed in. Instead, it was more so made like an eggrito, filled and folded. The grits were good, they were bigger grains than I'm used to but good nonetheless.

The service, the ambiance, THE FOOD! Boy o boy! From the warm honey biscuit to the Delmonico, to the decadent and rich chocolate cake!

I’m telling you if you appreciate good food, you’ll definitely enjoy this restaurant.', 'Fine dining at its best. My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary. This was our first time dining at Butcher and Singer and everything was excellent. Our server, Stacy, and the staff made our experience feel like 10 stars.  The honey biscuits, shrimp and crab louie salad, mash potatoes, lamb chops, and roasted chicken was absolutely scrumptious. They even made our day even more special, by helping to celebrate our anniversary.  We will definitely return in the very near future.  Thank you Butcher and Singer for making our special day even more special.', 'Hubby took me and the kids for my birthday. Food and service was amazing. Loved the atmosphere and the music playing in the background. This was a great experience. We will definitely revisit. Great spot for a celebration, date night or simply a meeting. Everything was done to perfection. Their biscuits are to die for. Oh so yummy!', 'Very relaxing atmosphere on a Sunday eve. Service is great. Female hostesses was arrogant. 2 little buns are awesome. As we were sitting and ready to order the nice waitress came and opened with a monologue about all the dishes that are not on the menu. it was something like five minutes that she didn’t stop talking and all I remember is the Wagyu beef from Australia that cost $165. Tartar Tuna was nice though it didn’t smell like a fresh fish. Stuffed hash browns is huge and shareable. If the porterhouse is so good, why do you have to sunk it in butter? The few leaves on the plate weren’t fresh at all with barely any taste, lame and tired. Green beans are fresh and nice, but nothing special. It’s basically green beans with almonds shavings and lemon zest. Butcher salad was fresh and refreshing. Cocktail menu is nice and creative especially if you like Manhattan’s, but nothing with Gin though having 13 bottles of Gin on the menu. The wine list is endless, easy to get lost in. We didn’t have any desserts, we were too full. All in all it’s OK and it feels like if you wanna impress someone you should go there due to the high prices.']"

The short rib was amazing as well.\n\nDefinitely worth the stop.', 'Don’t waste your money here. Been here several times and it’s consistently been disappointing.

If I'm ever in the area again I'll definitely keep this in mind as an option."", ""We went for sips and it was okay. $10 for a beer and burger was an amazing deal but the burger didn't settle very well. The employees looked sad and the service was just okay even tho it was pretty empty. Like the bartender seemed to have no interest in talking to us even tho we were the only ones on that half of the bar and tried to chat with him. The aesthetic was very confused and didn't have any theme even though it's a pretty small place. Weird place, not gonna go back"", 'The location and atmosphere of this place are excellent. However, the service, with the exception of the host, was quite poor. Our server was absent for long periods of time.\nThe food was expensive(for what you get), the portions were small, and the quality was inconsistent. The Nashville hot buns were deliciouslyyummy, offering a burst of well-balanced flavors with each bite. On the contrary, their version of fish and chips was simply disappointing. Some of the potatoes were overburnt and semi cold, while the fish tasted as a cheap frozen fishstick from the freezer aisle. Coleslaw was good.\nGiven these, I am uncertain whether I would return to this restaurant. I will probably explore other options in the area.']"

Very friendly greeting and thrumming with an early crowd at 5:30 on a Friday. It was Restaurant Week, sigh, so yes a good value menu but slammed. We opted for it—roast oysters, the crab pasta (very good) and Basque cheesecake. It was all solid, but a bit rushed. Not entirely fair to judge during Restaurant Week, so…there’s that. Would love to try other things and the wood fired pizza, great oven on prime view. Favorite drink? The Bork Bork Bork.', 'Another great find! Our dine around Philly led us here. Once again, google reviewers, thank you for your candid responses!!!  Tonight we did our final stop here! We actually asked a bartender at another restaurant what he thought of it and he said “go! If I wasn’t working, I would go there”.  While it was a great atmosphere, the food and service was even better. We ate more than we planned (as we had previous stops)! We had the tortellini and also the corn pasta (don’t judge), both were out of this world!! Service was also more than great! Thanks Max and all the others we bonded with', 'Great experience having a group brunch. Our server Caroline was excellent. Especially loved the crab pasta and the panna cotta dessert but everything was great. The decor is beautiful as well.', 'Great time all around at Wilder! Only in town for a couple of days and really wanted to go here. First, amazing responsiveness from Judy when trying to make our reservation. After arriving earlier than our reservation, we sat at the bar. We were lucky enough to come on a Thursday which meant we got Max and the other Max as our bartenders. They were a delight and we decided to pass on our table and stay at the bar for dinner. We had apps, a margarita pizza, ice cream and the sorbet. It was all fantastic and the happy hour prices on our drinks were a bonus. Cheers!']"

The sizes of each dish were perfect for allowing a taste of everything. The staff were proactive in making sure every option was always available. The chef in the kitchen was great explaining it each of the roast dishes available and was very friendly. The quality of the coffee is a good way to judge a brunch, and the coffee was great.

It was a buffet format and while the price tag was high, the experience was definitely worth it. The tons of food options were all tasty, including turkey, shrimp, oysters, and more.

Overall we had a great Thanksgiving meal and would do it again for sure.', 'Nice view by the park.\nGreat seven courses tasting menu！\nServers are professional and attentive.', ""This restaurant was average for me.  The food was very good.  However, I felt the servers were sub-par for a restaurant of this caliber.  The service was very slow after we were seated.\n\nThe female server brought us a bottle of wine we order that was spoiled.  She said that it tasted fine to her.  I have tasted thousands of bottles of wine and know good and bad wine.  I do NOT like the fact that they open the bottle at another location than the table.  Opening the wine is part of the process.\n\nWhen we walked into the restaurant there was a wait for anyone to appear.  And when he did, it felt like they were not expecting anyone to show.

They should walk down the Barkley Prime to see how it's done."", 'We ate here during our stay at the Rittenhouse and overall the restaurant was fine. When we came here for breakfast on Thanksgiving day, the service was incredibly slow which was really disappointing. It took forever for us to get our food and when it came out, it wasn’t even hot. When we came the next day, it was much faster and better. Omelettes, croissants, and egg dishes were overall good. Not much to complain about besides the slow service.']"

We ordered a delicious appetizer that contained a little bit of everything then, had a main course each, I particularly liked the pargo baracoa it just reminded of when I was a kid in the caribbean. The lechon asado was also delicious. Lastly we ordered a banana split to celebrate my friends birthday. This gigantic bowl of ice cream includes a show.', 'I really enjoyed my meal here.

Mish Mish,4.5,150,"['There were mixed reviews about this place but we still wanted to give it a try as reviews are always so subjective.\n\nThe “small plates” are not small for fine dining standards. I feel like the reviews that said the portions were small for the price they are paying are expecting Olive Garden portions knowing they are at a tapas fine dining establishment.\n\nThe dishes are supposed to be shared tapas style, so don’t expect to just order one dish as an entree. Order several dishes for the table and try a bit of everything. My favorite are the fried cheese, crispy potatoes, and steak. I think the eggplant was done really well too.\n\nWe dined indoor and there was a nice breeze from the large open windows. Loved that they noticed I was pregnant and offered pregnant friendly drink options and they even popped a candle on our dessert. It was a lovely last dinner date before the baby arrived.', ""So I wanted to go somewhere nice and new for our anniversary.

The menu is pretty small but the cocktail menu is only like 4 drinks. We got the fried string cheese, whipped potatoes, chicken kabobs and mackerel. It was allll so meh, I'm super disappointed. I was super hyped for this place too. For dessert there are only two options and we went with the sweet plantain bread with white ganache and hazelnuts.

The portions were large enough for two people to share. They do have a few non-alcoholic beverage options.\n\nSo, I'll keep the food portion brief as I think you should try it yourself. The fire grilled squash with tahini was my favorite and the dessert was jus enough to finish the meal with a cherry on top.\n\nThe bathrooms were well kept, comfortable, and the paper hand towels were soft as a Turkish bath robe.\n\nAll in all, I highly suggest this restaurant for a special occasion and a chef who obviously gives artistic thought to creating the menu."", 'The food was delicious!

I find it to be a great spot for a quick bite or even a bigger meal; the food is actually pretty good. I usually go here with my partner, and we always receive quick and efficient service. It was no different this week when I went with a group of my friends. The food was good. I ordered a variety of appetizers, and the drinks were also strong and great. However, I did find it a bit off-putting when the waiter seemed annoyed or didn't understand why we only ordered drinks and appetizers. She kept asking if we wanted anything else over and over again after we said no thank you multiple times. I'm not sure if that was just her personality or if she wanted us to buy more items. Overall, the experience wasn't bad at all. I will say, if you're not used to this place, beware that it's usually pretty loud in there, but it's not so loud that you aren't able to have a conversation with the people around you. I will be back because it has not disappointed me yet."", 'Definitely a cool restaurant. I enjoyed the ambiance although a bit loud. The steak tacos were delicious but not $17 worth.

I was nervous and a bit afraid to do so, but the staff here blew my expectations out of the water, especially those two ladies.\n\nCaisa greeted me upon walking in and got me a table together right away despite me coming through the accessible entrance, and offered for me to park my stroller.

My wife follows a no onion, no garlic diet, and when we informed Ana, her immediate response was, “we can make it the way you like.” This was incredibly comforting. Ana was super nice and efficient throughout our meal.\n\nWe started with zucchini fritters and mozzarella sticks. The zucchini fritters were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and bursting with fresh zucchini flavor. The mozzarella sticks were perfectly gooey, with a crispy golden crust that complemented the warm, melty cheese inside. Both appetizers were simply out of this world.\n\nFor the main course, I had the four cheese ravioli, which was rich, creamy, and decadent. The blend of cheeses created a symphony of flavors that was both comforting and satisfying. My son chose the mushroom pasta, which featured a deliciously earthy mushroom sauce that perfectly coated the al dente pasta. My wife had a made-to-order pasta, customized to her dietary needs, and it was expertly prepared with fresh, flavorful ingredients.\n\nDespite being full, we decided to share one vanilla ice cream for dessert. Ana surprised us by bringing a lemon-made cookie and a lovely strawberry in the middle with the chocolate syrup written “Congratulations!” It was a delightful touch that made the meal even more special.\n\nWe loved the ambiance and the great hall.

We had someone at our party who had a shellfish and seafood allergy. We swapped the mozzarella for the stuffed mushrooms. Both came out perfect. After, we ordered our entrees I ordered the chicken alfredo. We couldn't order dessert because of how stuffed we were but they did offer us cappuccinos and coffee after we told them how long of a drive we had to do.

Well done, team!"", 'I went here for the first time recently because I was in the area and in the mood for diner food. I couldn’t find any diners so I went here instead and it did NOT disappoint.

The environment was good but definitely a bit loud especially for the time of day I was there. If you don’t like noise or places that are bustling this spot probably isn’t for you. The service was great and food was delicious. I’d definitely go again.', ""A++ Food\nNaw these were the best pancakes I've ever had. I ordered the Cinnamon Roll pancakes They were Large and Fluffy!!

My husband and I also got the Sunday Gravy (which they were offering on a Saturday). I really enjoyed the pasta but the meatball, sausage, and short rib were all good too (my husband really liked the short rib). I feel like I would’ve enjoyed another pasta dish instead of Sunday Gravy more though. We also got the Stracciatella which was good (we asked for olives on the side though since we aren’t huge fans of olives). Our server was also very kind in letting us know that olives are in the dish in case we didn’t like them—and thank goodness she told us because we totally missed it!

Everything we ordered was perfectly cooked. I was disappointed with the 6-hour duck breast - too salty and the texture was chewy. I can tell they take pride in the sauces as everything had a sauce and it was delicious despite the saltiness. I think the fried potatoes could use less sauce in proportion to the potatoes since it’s very smokey and strong. The “small plates” are actually the sizes of mains so we made the mistake of ordering too much thinking they were appetizer portions. I wish our waiter did a better job of explaining this as we told him it was our first time there. We told him what we were thinking of ordering to get his suggestion and he basically said our selection was good. Best dishes we had: beef tartare on toast (1 for 2 ppl- the bread is delicious but very filling as it’s a thick piece of toast), half chicken, artichoke, roast eggplant, and the octopus salad. For 2 ppl sharing everything, I recommend getting 1 “on toast”, 1 veg, 2 small plates, and 1 large. We didn’t get dessert. The kitchen counter is a bit tight as it seats 6 people and it’s slightly curved on both ends. The decor and atmosphere is simple and a bit too dark in the dining room.

It gives it a whimsical, and magical vibe. The servers are so attentive and kind. They also are highly knowledgeable about the food.\n\nThe food was incredible! They change the menu every two weeks, and it is served in courses. While they asked if we have any allergies, this does not seem like the spot for picky eaters as the menu is set. The best dish we had was the tomato salad. The tomatoes were fresh, and peeled. I still think about how amazing that salad is over a month later. The only dish I was not a fan of were the clams that were an add on. They did not taste that fresh.

But this restaurant lived up to the hype. They gave us small chocolate chip cookies at the end, which were amazing. And we left with tiny packs of duck fat chex mix--also excellent. The vibe was great, small and intimate. The service was great--refilling our water pitcher and giving us new plates and silverware when needed. The only sucky thing about this place is that it is not wheelchair accessible (have to go up stairs to get inside) and it's so small inside I am unsure a wheelchair could maneuver around in there (maybe sit at the table right by the doors?).

They apologize saying that the food has sat while they waited for all the other food to get done on the table meaning other people orders, the next time it  had to be return was because it was pure blood. we just gave up. The last time the steak was well done overcooked. I think it was because they put one f the steak in the microwave to heat it up and it was rubberized from the microwave.

Most people at the table had to send their order back and when the one lady at the table waited over 45 for her food after the waitress said it would be out in 20 minutes she told them she been there for two hours waiting and was ready to go and no longer need her meal.

This place does not care about you as a customer; they care about the number of people they can get in and out. The fried cauliflower, which came out cold and soaked in oil, clearly represents that.

A server is frequently serving others next to you, reaching over you, which makes it quite hard to even enjoy your meal.\n\nAfter finishing the bland “food,” our plates were immediately taken away, and the check was handed to us without asking if there was anything else we needed.

I would recommend having a bite of the waffles with the chicken, the turkey bacon (or ham), and the syrup altogether, as otherwise the waffles could be a bit dry.

I can’t remember the young man’s name at the valet but he was comical. Manny, at the door, was very polite. Our reservation wasn’t quite ready yet when we arrived so we sat at the bar to have drinks while we waited. Mel was such an amazing bartender we actually learned a great deal from her. The old fashioned that she made for me was excellent! Bob was very attentive. He saw we were having a slight issue with a spilled drink and came over immediately to rectify the situation. He was also super knowledgeable about drinks in general. Made a great recommendation for champagne. The food was good. I did wish the sea bass had a little more back end on the broccolini but the taste was still good. The lobster mac & cheese was wonderful. Absolute yes on the butter cake for dessert. All in all we had a great time.', 'We celebrated our anniversary here lastnight. It was a wonderful experience. From the friendly hostesses , welcoming bartender. Amazing drinks.\nOur server Jim made our night so great. Service was top tier . Steaks were cooked to perfection. Managers stopped by to see if we needed anything else. Was a great touch !\nBathrooms are cleaned & I couldn’t help but notice staff cleaning and polishing wine glasses and making sure tables were perfect. Clean restaurant .\nCan’t wait to return\nThanks Jim & Ocean Prime', 'Consistently amazing!   I don’t think you can go wrong with anything on this menu.  Everything is top quality from the service, to the presentation to the portions and the quality of the food.\n\nI remember the first time we went came to Ocean Prime a little under a year ago and have been wanting to get back ever since and try some other selections.\n\nStarted with the lobster bisque which had several decent size pieces of lobster.   A very good bisque  that tastes like fall with its subtle hints of various herbs and spices .   We also split the Ocean Roll, which was devious and fresh.   Even my son who doesn’t enjoy fish said it was good.\n\nMains were three steaks, which were tender and cooked to perfection, and the flavorful teriyaki salmon.\n\nFor dessert we shared the ten layer carrot cake and the chocolate peanut butter pie.   I can’t say more then if you like chocolate and peanut butter this is a must!   The carrot cake was also top notch and I typically don’t order cake.\n\nSince it was restaurant week we’re were able to get an app, a main and dessert for $60 for tow of the selections,  which was a tremendous deal.\n\nI was disappointed to find that they are removing the “Take Two”  from the cocktail menu.   I “settled” for the pineapple picante which was a more then adequate replacement.\n\nCan’t wait to go back!', ""Celebrated an early father's day here and we weren't disappointed. Overall, the food was good and presented well. The halibut was amazing as well as the truffle mac and cheese. The drinks weren't worth the price. The service was immaculate. We'd definitely  return.""]"
Osteria,4.5,1250,"['We had the most amazing wedding at Osteria July 2024. From the beginning the entire staff was so attentive, accommodating, and thoughtful when it came to planning beforehand and throughout the night. From the cocktails, late night pizza, and the dessert room our guests only had great things to say. Our wedding felt like the ultimate intimate dinner party with all 120 of our loved ones and we are so happy to have a spot to always go back to for future celebrations. (Photo credit to Heidi Roland for capturing the essence of Osteria!)', 'We made a reservation for a date night before seeing a show. We had a great experience here. They have indoor and outdoor seating. The outside area is beautiful. All of the staff are very attentive. Every time we finished something someone was there within a minute to remove it. Our server was attentive and made good recommendations. The food was excellent! We had the octopus, a pasta dish, and the halibut. The dishes were on the smaller side but everything was delicious. We enjoyed our time here and we will return.', 'We always have an amazing experience at Osteria. From the moment you walk in the door, you’re greeted with smiles. The ambiance there, with fresh plants and greenery, gives the restaurant a cozy feeling. I truly feel like they treat their guests like family. The food is phenomenal. Our personal favorites are the francobolli, chicken liver rigatoni, and the brown sugar budino. Their menu changes seasonally, but some menu items are offered year round. Service is also 10/10 from management down. Special shout out to Ryan!', 'Wonderful dinner. The service was professional, friendly and knowledgeable, and many staff attended to us through dinner. The food is fantastic. We were told portions  were a bit small so as a couple we ordered 5 dishes across 3 courses. All were excellent. Definitely a top restaurant in Philly. Vibe was nice with a bit casual hipster thrown in. Would return.', ""Osteria has an exceptional happy hour! In terms of value to quality of food and experience, I don't think you can get too much better than their happy hour. Everything on the menu is $8-$12 including the outstanding pasta and pizza dishes. In particular I would recommend the chicken liver rigatoni; it's a deeply rich and flavorful pasta that is comforting and enjoyable.\n\nI also appreciated our server who prepared us an amaro flight for dessert, showing us the amaros he selected and talking about each one. I enjoy amaro but haven't had a good opportunity like this to try several all at once so it was greatly appreciated!\n\nThe atmosphere in the restaurant is very intimate and cozy. There is also a very nice large outdoor seating area with twisting vines and trees wrapping around the terrace. My only note would be that some of the seats in the outdoor area like ours ended up being very noisy- the restaurant's proximity to Broad street means that if you get a seat closer to the road it will be distractingly loud.""]"
Butcher Bar,4.4,1483,"['Had a great experience with Johnny as our waiter. Super friendly, great conversation and had the perfect sense for when we needed something. 10/10 service Johnny.\nWe went during restaurant week this time and were slightly underwhelmed. The proportions on the starters were massive (positives and negatives) and were the highlight of our dinner flavor wise. Nothing was bad, but our entrees were lacking some flavor this time.\nThe cocktail menu is wonderful though, great place to come for happy hour.\nOverall not a bad place to go, but we’ve had some swings in our food flavors.', 'I went with a larger group and ordered the trough and a couple salads. It was a TON of food but each part of it was very enjoyable. I particularly liked the chicken and the burnt ends. Our group (all guys) barely touched The fries and even had some of the meat leftover.\n\nThe service was great! They were accommodating and parking was relatively easy to find (considering it was in the city). Overall a great experience one I would highly recommend to everyone at least once.', 'I had an amazing time coming here for restaurant week ! My husband and I love traveling to try new restaurants and I’m happy that we finally got a chance to knock this one off our list. The service and food options were perfect.

I will definitely be coming back here to try their full menu for sure !', 'Came here to celebrate a birthday brunch for a friend and we had a ball in here!  Must must make reservations if you want to get In for brunch but so worth it. They have a couple bottomless drink options for brunch (we tried all the options  bloody Mary’s, mimosas and I believe passion fruit margaritas? and they did not cinch on the alcohol which is rare for an all you can drink spot!) we all ordered something different and it was all pretty tasty. I recommend the French toast bites, the potato waffle fries and the breaded chicken sandwich. I’m a huge red velvet fan but the red velvet pancakes they served did not have much flavor although they were plated beautifully. Only thing I wish was that the upstairs (where we sat for our brunch) was bigger because it tends to get a little tight. I have suggested this place to many looking for a brunch spot in the city and none have been disappointed yet (:', 'Very good wood fired steak. Cool atmosphere. We had a great window seat.

Vedge,4.8,1606,"['Excellent vegetable-forward plant based eatery and fine dining experience. The food  was fantastic, as were the cocktails and the service.\n\nWe started with a cocktail at the bar; Vedge has great happy hour specials served at the bar on weeknights from 5-7pm.\n\nOnce seated at our table, we ordered the rutabaga fondue, which may have been my favorite dish of all — so good, with unique, savory flavors that are really hard to find among vegan food. Also ordered the stuffed avocado (very tasty), squash (the aji sauce was 🔥), carrot dish, and Dan Dan noodles (these were so tasty, and nice sized portion). Everything was excellent - creatively prepared and delicious. For dessert ordered the pumpkin bread, which was super.\n\nGreat dinner. Great spot for a date night.', 'All around, probably the single best elevated dining experience I’ve ever had. Spent some time at the bar before we got our table, bartenders were attentive, friendly and went out of their way to make us feel welcome, even offering us complimentary (NA) shots that served as a sort of a preview of a new drink they had in the works. We did the three course Vedge experience so we got to try most of the menu. Every dish was outstanding and unique, even offerings that sounded like something familiar from their menu description defied and surpassed expectations. A true one of a kind experience.', 'Always an excellent experience at Vedge where the dishes are so complex and delicious it’s easy to decide that a meal without meat is not only possible but worth it. Our server was helpful as our guest hadn’t been before- we basically got half the menu and shared it - 2 dishes are enough for a moderate eater and 3 are good for a heartier meal. Plus there’s always dessert!', ""Fantastic experience at Vedge!  My wife has special dietary restrictions - and we emailed ahead and they were happy to accommodate.  The food was unbelievable good - we did the Vedge experience and picked three courses each plus dessert.  I added on the wine pairing which was excellent.  My wife's favorite was the Eggplant Braciole, and my favorite was the Smoked Portobella Carpaccio.  We also added on the Rutabaga Fondue - which was so creamy and cheesy tasting - and the warm fresh pretzel and pickled veggies were absolutely perfect with the fondue.   The restaurant itself is a great experience - the ambiance is great - and we had a seat in the front by the window.  The old leaded glass windows and wood details overall were so nice.  Our server Colin was great!  He was super nice and attentive.  For parking - the Hamilton garage just down the street was easy in and out, and a short walk from the restaurant.  It is only $15 after 5pm on Saturday.  We don't make it to Philly very often - but now when we go in the future we will definitely make a reservation and dine at Vedge every time!  Highly recommend!"", 'The service at Vedge is very nice and welcoming. The scenery has a simple sophisticated style and the setting is cozy without being overly crowded. My partner and I opted for The Vedge Experience which allows you to choose 3 dishes and a desert. I ordered the chilled cucumber and avocado soup, the charred broccoli and avocado, and the eggplant braciole. My partner ordered the summer tomatoes, Dan Dan noodles, and the campfire carrot. We ordered the rhubarb cheesecake and pistachio pudding cake. We absolutely loved the desserts! The presentation of the food is very well done and pleasing to the eye. The portions are a little smaller than I’d like. The food was very interesting. We were a bit underwhelmed at the restaurant by the flavors but enjoyed everything the next day at home when we ate it all together on one plate. The food that had more flavor to it helped out the food that didn’t have as much flavor. We could have gone without the tomatoes and the carrot. Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience and I give it a 3.5.']"
Buddakan,4.6,2383,"['The food was interesting, succulent, and just overall delicious. The lamb chap was cooked to perfection and the salad with it had a nice kick.

Can’t go wrong here!', 'Despite poor lighting the overall experience was good. The waiter was attentive and went above and beyond to ensure dietary needs were meant. The food was absolutely delicious! I would recommended this restaurant. It would be great for a date night.', 'The apps were very good. I got the sashimi and shrimp bao buns and they were both really flavorful and delicious. The high expectations from the apps made me a bit disappointed on our entrees. The pad Thai was salty, I’m not sure if the chef accidentally added too much salt or something but it was salty. The sauce was very good but the saltiness was overwhelming. The black pepper beef was also good but I felt it was missing rice. The beef was very tender and flavorful but a side of rice would’ve made it even more good and would balance the strong flavor of the beef sauce. I feel other places usually serve black pepper beef with rice but I guess it somewhat ruins the aesthetic.\nWe also got cheesecake and dim sum donuts. They were pretty good, I liked the richness of the cheesecake and the donuts are classic Chinese donuts (I’m not sure if the 14$ price tag for the donuts is worth it tho).\n\nOverall it was a pretty decent place, we went on wed night but it was a bit busy', 'Buddakan is definitely one of my favorite places in Center City. It’s upscale, great cocktails, a nice selection of vegan and vegetarian menu. It’s best to make reservations ahead especially if you are planning to go to dinners on a weekend nights. Our host was very knowledgeable and gracious. Food tasted phenomenal, will definitely be coming back many more times.']"

The Victor Cafe Restaurant was a unique experience,during dinner while you eat every so often someone from the staff will sing Oprah. Also if you have a birthday the staff brings you out some cake and some of them will Oprah sing happy birthday. The staff here was very friendly and helpful with the menu as it was most of o first timers here.the restaurant was busy at the time we were here and seemed loud to me when we were trying to have a conversation other than when someone was singing. The tables also seemed very close to each other but were able to walk around the restaurant. The walls of the restaurant are covered in Oprah singes over the years. I had the Spaghetti Rusticana.,it was good but was not far from my favorite.

In the movies, the restaurant is called Adrian’s Restaurant, named after the late wife of Rocky Balboa, owned by the Rocky character.\n\nIf you’re a fan of the film series, visiting the restaurant is a must. At the back of the dining room, the painting from the end of Rocky 3 is displayed.\n\nThe restaurant itself is interesting, with a louder atmosphere than I was expecting. I found the menu to be somewhat limited, food itself was ok. The place is also known for opera style singing during dinner. While this is a unique offering with talented server/singers, it is also a bit distracting and can be uncomfortable if you’re just trying to enjoy your meal.\n\nIn any case, if you’re a Rocky fan, you definitely need to visit The Victor Café.', 'I was looking for some good Italian food so this place was suggested by a friend. I started with a spicy pomegranate margarita, that was suggested by my server , baby the spice level was on 100, I couldn’t take two sips it was tooooo hot. Then I tried a regular margarita 5/10. For appetizers I ordered fried calamari and mussels in a red sauce, both of them was great!  For my entree I ordered Linguine Fra Diavolo. It was tasteless. It was very much bland. I did really enjoy the opera singers! All of them were amazing! That was the best part of my experience.', 'Truly the highlight of my summer. While I don’t live in Philadelphia my new love brought me here for a special date night.

Very surprised that Morimoto doesn’t have a Michelin star yet because it is well deserved!', 'I came with a group and had the tasting menu with the drink pairings. Everything was amazing. I’ve been here a couple of times and the standard menu is all really good. Drink pairings was a diverse selection of sake, and wine.', 'An amazing restaurant in Philadelphia. If you are going anywhere, choose this one! Finally got to sit at the sushi bar, loved it. Went on a not over crowded night and it was so amazing!

My husband and I were traveling for work in Philly and discovered this place by accident on our first night there walking around the downtown to look for a place to dine in. We quickly looked through the photos and menu on google map (thanks, fellow reviewers!) and decided to head in. We ended up going here once more on your last night.\n\nFood was awesome. We tried salads, pastas, a plate, a pizza, and deserts. Everything (except for the seasonal soft shell crab) was GOOD. Ingredients tasted fresh and flavorful, presentation was neat, and seasoning was just right (not too salty or sweet) and soo good. I liked how their food had a little of twist in terms of ingredient or seasoning, which made their food taste unique and so yummy.\n\nService wise, we got served by the same server both times (sorry we didn’t get your name), and he was very welcoming and attentive.\n\nAdditionally, we sat at their open kitchen bar on our first visit. The kitchen was so fun to look at, and wasn’t too smoky or smelly. I love watching professional chefs cook, but often times dislike restaurants with open kitchen due to too strong of smoke and smell. This place was a pleasant surprise in this aspect as well.\n\nLastly, their price wasn’t too high compared to the quality and quantity of food served. It’s well worth it.\n\nI would HIGHLY recommend this place and also visit again whenever I am back in Philly.', 'Enjoyed a delicious dinner at the chef counter. Portions are small, but meant to be shared. For an appetizer, salad, hanger steak and dessert (the budino is amazing!) the total was $66. Not bad!

Would come back!', ""My daughter and I celebrated birthdays with a show and early dinner at Barbuzzo.  It was our first time to dine here.  We were fortunate to visit during restaurant week.   The menu had several very good choices making it hard to pick.  The portions were remarkably large compared to similar events at other restaurants.   The arancini was the best I've ever had.  The bronzino was crispy and cooked to perfection!  Top it off with a good cocktail and 2 wonderful desserts .  The atmosphere was a bit dark for my taste but minor detail.  We will definitely return!"", 'STELLAR!!!!!!!!! The staff. The ambiance. The food! Yes to all of it. I’m in Philly for a Tech Conference and I googled best Mediterranean restaurant near me. Google gave me four options. So glad I picked this one. Small plates that are served as they become ready. We were a party of three and luckily I was with folks who like to sample and share! Everything we ordered was phenomenal. Service was great, quick…. We arrived at 5 when they opened and by 5:30 it was packed. So you probably want to make a reservation or try your luck. I took a picture of everything we ordered except the meat balls which tasted like the best meatloaf you ever had in your life. Highly recommend this place. So sorry I didn’t go to the bathroom - I typically do a review of bathroom cleanliness as well. Anyway-if you are downtown Philly - this spot is really fun!']"
Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse,4.5,3557,"[""Place had a very refined atmosphere. Nice the way they used an old bank. The food was great with plenty of options. The waitress was very knowledgeable as well as honest. She really took care of my party. Steaks were cooked spot on and the sides where solid. Drink menu was solid as well.

You'll enjoy your experience."", 'It was my third time here and I brought my daughter this time. We both really enjoyed the food. She had dynamite shrimp and the crab cakes.

It is a little pricey, but as I said, everything is commensurate with what you get in quality and quantityis a diamond and a rough I’ve been here before and I’ve never saw that on the menu. I can’t wait to return just to have that the seafood is fresh. The steaks are amazing. The lobster on top. The steak is mouthwatering, but I still hold the crabcakes. I think it’s one of their most underrated dishes, and yet one of the most delicious.', 'I made reservations through John the General Manager, and expressed my not so good past experiences at other steakhouses with the low quality of steaks and how some restaurants have change. He reassured me that me and my friend I treat out to Del Frisco’s experience will be a great experience and the quality of the food. My food was great but my friend’s Ribeye steak was very salty. The manger with the big earring in his ear was rude and tried to justify the reason for the overally salted steak. So, needless to say I ate my food while we had to wait for her steak to be cooked again. After spending a little over $300 on our meals. I felt like we were treated less important by the manger that was there yesterday on Saturday July 13th at 6pm was my reservations. This made me not want to go back and tell other friends of Del Frisco’s. I hope this doesn’t happen to any of your future guests. I work for a Headquarters company in the Philadelphia area and have been to many restaurants that I have been treated better even if the quality of food was not up to par!']"

Right from the start, the service was excellent. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable, taking the time to discuss the menu and highlight the best dining options for us.\n\nEverything we ordered was extremely fresh. The orange juice in the Mimosa was vibrant and refreshing, setting the perfect tone for our meal. The eggs tasted incredibly fresh, and I could tell they were sourced with care.\n\nOne standout item was the made-on-site croissants; they were simply delicious! And if you're a biscuit lover, the made-from-scratch biscuits are a must-have. They were flaky and flavorful, complementing our meal perfectly.\n\nOverall, High Street Restaurant and Bar offers a delightful dining experience with outstanding service and fresh, delicious food. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a great meal in a welcoming atmosphere!"", 'The food was decent but not amazing. I had the shakshuka - 2 out of the 3 egg yolks were fully cooked. There wasnt any particular fragrance about it. My husband had the croissant with egg and ham - the salad was fantastic; couldnt taste much of the croissant though. Another person had the eggs with bacon, potatoes and sourdough toast. Sunny side up eggs were perfect. Potatoes tasted great - actually the best potatoes we had in philadelphia. It was quite odd that there werent any butter/jam provided with the toast though. We also had the buttermilk biscuit - came with butter/jam. Was flaky but nothing amazing.', ""We stumbled upon High Street while in town for a show and we're so glad we did! The food was incredible and you could easily tell that each dish was made with quality fresh ingredients. We were equally impressed with the service and atmosphere.

We came for brunch and each had a dish, a coffee, and shared a scone and only paid 35 a person after the included 20% gratuity (which they make very clear is included and are not trying to scam you into extra). The baked eggs are the perfect option if you like shakshuka but maybe want it more on the egg side over the tomatoe-y side. The dutch baby was a perfect sweet and tangy balance. The scone was perfect in taste and texture. Staff was super kind and answered all qs, I also overheard them happily making a substitution for another table. Such a great spot!']"
Dutch Eating Place,4.7,897,"['First time visiting Philly and this being my first meal in the city, what an introduction.

I’ve travelled all over the country from the west to east coasts and in between and I can safely say this spot hit in a way most do not.\n\nThe food was delicious and big portioned. I ordered the meat and cheese omelet, one pancake, a side of ham, and a cup of orange juice. The pancake is probably the biggest I’ve ever been served so fair warning if ordering a stack of pancakes with the rest of your meal.\n\nThe seating is close quarters, bar style so just keep in mind if coming with a big group or if you’re averse to having little personal space but honestly, wasn’t a big deal to me personally.\n\nHighly recommend if you’re in Philly to check this place out!', 'If you’re in Philadelphia and visiting the Reading Terminal Market, be sure to visit The Dutch Eating Place! It has a very basic retro diner style setup where you can sit and eat at the counter, or you can order your food to go.\n\nI tried the 2 egg breakfast along with toast, bacon, sausage and home fries cooked with onions and peppers. The breakfast was massive, food was excellent. There was so much food I had to take three pictures at different angles to show it all.\n\nReally enjoyed the atmosphere, had conversations with other customers also sitting at the counter, great experience.', ""The Scrapple here is legendary but I recommend eating it with mustard vs syrup! The pancakes are delicious but I only get one and don't forget the freshly squeezed orange juice. It does get busy so plan on waiting a little bit before you grab a seat first come first serve"", 'Amish food is always very good with fresh ingredients. This sandwich was pretty good but I wish they’d left out the extra butter that was maybe placed on top of the bread. It cause my bread to be a little soggy and kind of salty. I took one side of the bread off and enjoyed the rest of the sandwich. All in all, I would return again !', ""Okay, we were in Philadelphia taking care of business, and my spouse and I were looking for a good, reasonable place to have breakfast. That's when we came across the Dutch Eating Place...it was tight and there were a lot of people waiting for takeout and the same amount sitting down, tightly, to enjoy this food. It didn't seem much like a Dutch establishment other than our server wearing a Dutch outfit, including the bonnet. She was a very pleasant person. But maybe it was the amount of food that is a hallmark of Dutch breakfast, because it was a lot of great tasting victals. My wife and I looked at the menu and both decided to have a vegetable omelette. The omelette alone would have been satisfyingly enough. However, we wanted some hash browns, and that took up the rest of the plate. Furthermore, we had two slices of wheat toast, which was piled on top of the rest of the food (see pic). Still, it was such a good omelette--I must emphasize (wife agrees). And I forgot about the coffee, which had a wonderful taste even though it was out of a paper cup. I highly recommend the Dutch Eating Place when you're around 10th avenue in Philadelphia.""]"
Amada,4.5,2123,"['My husband and I went here for a fancy dinner and were not disappointed!

And the food itself was amazing!', 'My rating is reflected upon how well the staff handled the situation. My husband and I are huge foodies and I’ve attended culinary school. We had high expectations for a restaurant by an Iron Chef. We ordered the tasting menu, which has certain expectations. It was very different from what we expected. We are not their average clientele. The food is good and elevated for the normal person. We are not normal people.\n\nThe service was amazing! They were very attentive and the atmosphere is very warm and inviting. The drinks were fabulous. I had the sangria which was spiced and not sweet and a chili tequila drink.\n\nFor food we had the tasting menu each. Progressive tasting menus should be light to heavy and follow a certain pattern. The items on the menu didn’t reflect what a normal tasting menu should be. The items were very heavy and had execution issues such as, very oily green beans, soggy scallops, and steak that had no acidic salsa verde. Many of the sauces were broken and oily. The traditional tapas were elevated than the normal tapas, but consideration should be into the types of dishes and ingredients. Also brightening things up with citrus and vinegar. For the average person, it’s amazing. I should have dug deeper into reviews from food critics.\n\nIf you are looking for traditional tapas and nice cocktails, this would be your spot. If you are a foodie like us, I would reconsider.', 'Hands down one of the best dinners I’ve had! The food was exceptional! Everything was fresh and full of flavor.

Oyster House,4.6,2415,"['BAR REVIEW ONLY.  Came here 3pm Saturday for a late lunch—found two seats at the bar so we sat there.  Unfortunately they were only serving items off their mid-day menu which was pretty limited.\n\nGot a dozen Raw Oysters which was great.  Tried the Londener Oyster Shot which had dill gin with the oyster—quite delicious!  Food wise, we got the Fried Seafood Platter and Burger, both fairly good dishes but I wish the fried seafood was more salty, their batter was bland.  The Manhattan Clam Chowder was just okay.  But overall, service here was great!', 'Visiting here from Colorado, I’m used to a limited oyster selection. So, imagine my delight when I stumbled upon this oyster haven boasting a whopping eight different varieties! We actually ordered extra 4 more on top of 2 dozens one of the types from Main not sure of the name after 2 oyster shooters, the shot bigger than normal .\nThe vibe is undeniably chill and fun, making it the perfect spot to catch up with friends. It’s clear that this place knows how to bring the beach to the city . Service is good', ""In town for a conference, I randomly selected Oyster House based on reviews - it did not disappoint!!!\n\nI made a reservation through Google - the ladies offered me a seat at the Oyster Bar! Yes!  To be honest, I've eaten oysters in Texas with lots of sauce, but I've never really thought deeply about Oysters.  The guys behind the bar were awesome - offering information (as well as my server).  I elected to try 4-5 different oysters with no sauce.  I also learned not to pierce my oysters with the fork!  Met some very nice people at the bar during my visit and had great service overall!  I would love to visit again!"", 'Absolutely incredible! I got two raw oysters based on the bartenders recommendation, the rockefeller oysters, grilled oysters, roasted honeynut squash and clam chowder.

A must have!!!\n-The blackberry point oysters!!!!! Absolutely delicious!!!!\n- Our server was so pleasant and attentive\nCons:\n- Receiving our crostini AFTER we completely finished our mussels and AFTER they have already been given to the guests next to us.\n-Wish the mussels were in a more thinner/broth sauce; keep the delicacy of the mussel.\nExtra Notes:\n-The Cherrystone clams are not for the weak!\nOverall:\nWe are so pleased to have finally came here after walking by so many times! Definitely a gem! We will be back!!!']"
Jean-Georges Philadelphia,4.5,597,"['Everything started well: the place cannot be more stunning that it is. Unfortunately for me it was raining and the was no view. I was taken care of as soon as I arrive. Waited for about 10 mints since I arrive 45 mints earlier to my reservation, they gave me water, I ordered a wine and they also gave me popcorn. Later someone came to sit me down. I was a party of me, myself and I. I ordered 3 items that you will be able to see in the receipt. Apparently there was a miscommunication with the first person who brought me the wine. I didn’t notice he had brought something different and after tasting the wine just agreed to it because it was delicious. After getting the check, we realized the mistake and Alessandro came over to the table, one of the managers, he apologized and took the wine glass off the check. That is what I would expect of a high end place, if they hadn’t taken care of it, I would have probably left with a bad taste. Not because of the price, you don’t come to this places thinking is gonna be a $50 dollar meal, but because in cases like this one, there’s no other solution to make sure the client is 100% satisfied. Will also recommend Sarah and Jonathan for their great service. I took some of the food to go since I don’t eat a lot in one seating and the risotto was a little bigger than what I thought an appetizer would be. My favorite for sure was the sea bass. Probably the best I’ve had in a long time. I would definitely come back and bring my friends next time I’m in Philly.', 'My boyfriend and I had a lovely experience here a few weeks ago! The view was gorgeous, the service was incredible, and the food was delicious.

Everyone was friendly, professional and knowledgeable. This restaurant was actually a bucket list item but the food failed to live up to the hype. We had the 5th anniversary tasting menu. Food that was supposed to be served hot was cold, the lobster tough, we could barely cut through it or completely inedible which was the squab. The best part of the meal was the dessert! The tasting menu was overpriced! I think the restaurant is worth a try but maybe when it's a regular menu."", ""What an incredible ambiance! It's a stunning place. The food was just ok, but the mocktails and cocktails were delicious. The only issue is the elevator. There are three elevators, and one of them should go directly to the restaurant. We stopped on one of the floors, and folks got on with their bags and dry cleaning. The stop confused everyone. Skyhigh should liken it to Attico or Assembly, where you hop on the elevator and straight off into the venue. Other than that, I highly recommend it, if only for the amazing ambiance."", ""A truly magical experience.

I can’t imagine going anywhere else.', 'A very special dinner at a very special place. The service was the warmest most knowledgeable I’ve ever enjoyed. The tasting plus wine tasting enabled me to understand and appreciate the relationship between food and wine for the first time. Can’t wait for an occasion to dine again.', 'Service is good. Everything was delicious except for the bass which was very hard to cut with the fork and knife and it felt inconsistently cooked throughout. It was a grilled bass but some parts of it matched the same texture as sushi which was concerning. I looked around and it look like other diners were struggling to cut it as well. I wish I said something during the dinner because for $165/person I expect the food to live up to the price. Overall, the food was great but not worth $165/person in my opinion! If I’m spending that much money, I expect to be WOWed like I was at Remy on the Disney Cruise Ship.']"

Good hunks of meat. Could be a tad more tender but otherwise it’s very good meat.\n\n2. Soup tastes normal for Pho soup. It’s about what you would expect. Salty of course, but in a good way.\n\n3. I think if the restaurant would add the bread stick (油条) it would be even better. That way, you can dip it into the soup and eat. Yummy!\n\nSummary: it is very good and tastes like authentic Pho.', 'I visited friends in Philly and by far, Pho 75 has best Pho I’ve ever had. I’ve had my fair share of Pho but the flavor and taste of their broth is amazing. I recommend the fatty flank soup as it has the perfect proportion between noodles, meat, and broth. It’s a well-balanced meal and just enough to make you feel full. Will definitely be coming back and a special thanks to Mike for assisting me throughout my whole experience.', 'Always worth the drive.

Our group ended up being smaller than expected due to call outs but Mixto staff had everything set up and we were able to keep the seats designated for us. We were seated timely on the 2nd floor with a beautiful ambience. Staff was friendly, attentive, pleasant and professional. Food was good with exceptional advertised plates. However, the Paella Vegetarian dish could use more seasoning and it seems like the salad was missing dressing but we received some on the side by request. The appetizers (plantain chip with guacamole, pork skins and chicken empanadas) and margarita pitchers were very good. The atmosphere and ambience was wonderful, it is easy to talk and hear, very relaxing, staff is visible and observant. We caught the bartender singing with the festive music and beats fitting the occasion perfectly.  They have a bar on both levels of restaurant. The 2nd floor has a restroom. It was a good time catching up with friends and celebrating birthday's. The staff did a wonderful display for bday celebration giving you smiles whether you know the person or not and the cake desert was most appreciated. Also, parking was 2-3 hours on Street and there is a lot a block away. I parked 1 block from the restaurant on street paying less than $6 for 2 hours.\n\nThank you Mixto Restaurant Staff for all the effort and attention in providing excellent service and beautiful memories. Keep up the great work!!!"", 'Dinner here was great! We were seated as soon as we arrived for our reservation and the service was excellent.

Crab curry has a very enjoyable heat and flavor, and it came with an unreal stuffed banana pepper and a boiled egg/fish sauce I’ll never forget. Thai tea tiramisu was a perfect finish. Riley and Alessandra at the bar took amazing care with us and deserve a raise. This spot is truly special. Trust.', 'Had a really wonderful dinner here!

However, because we were waiting on some members of our party to return from a boat tour and wanted to be attentive and aware of their return, she kindly offered to let us sit outside.

I wondered why this place was empty on a Friday night. Then the food came. We ordered the asparagus soup — it was sour and lacked seasoning. For entrees we ordered the scallops, branzino, and a filet mignon. All the dishes were incredibly underwhelming and under seasoned. Visually it looked appetizing, but the depth of flavor was as deep as a puddle. The stand out dishes were the sides: hominy mashed potato’s, Brussels sprouts, and the mushrooms.

They had a good flavor but the crispness of the sear on the brussels sprouts with soft as they probably sat for a little while before being served. Wouldn’t be a big deal, but for the price you do expect something closer to perfection. The snapper is the highlight of our dinner. It was prepared perfectly, lots of great textures, and flavors.

Today they had their sign and Paella was back. I’m so upset that I’ve been missing out on this place for so long. It’s build your own paella. From walking into the front entrance to the chef and server, service was fantastic. Nothing fake, nothing forced, just pure good hospitality. I work down the street and this place was open for lunch and the prices are more than reasonable. Portion size was great and the flavor was so delicious. Definitely will be coming back with friends and family. The atmosphere is very light, great music, the decor and space to eat is wonderful as well. I did sit indoor but if you’d like some fresh air, there is outdoor seating available. I had chicken shrimp sausage paella and all the flavors were there. The rice was cooked correctly and everything mixed very well. The chef was friendly, informative, and quick with the order. Overall 10/10 in my books']"
Tony G's Soul Food,4.4,2268,"['What a Wonderful  Experience!! I  came here for my Birthday Lunch  🎂  and  the service was impeccable 👌  And the food absolutely delicious! Thank you  to my  Amazing friend  for bringing  me  here for  my birthday! I  promise  you  I will return,  Sunday for Jazz !', ""Tony G's is on my first ballot hall of fame, for restaurants you must eat at!\nI'm in San Antonio. I ain't never been here before. I got myself a room at this little cockroach ridden motel over there by petrol gas station on Ackerman. I'll write a review on this place later\nI was really craving chinese food when I looked on uber eats for a place to order from. As I was scrolling down, I ran across Tony G's soul food. Where I live at in washington state, there ain't a whole lot of soul food restaurants. So I'm not gonna let this opportunity pass to have some good down-home cooking.\nI ordered a lot. Mainly because I was hungry. But, also, because I wanted to try everything on the menu.\nI ordered the catfish with steamed rice, and okra with tomatoes.\nAnd I also ordered the oxtails with macaroni and cheese and collard greens.\nAnd I also ordered a side of green beans, fried cabbage, and buttered corn.\nThen for dessert, I went with peach cobbler and sweet potato pie.\nAnd since I made it seem as though I was ordering for 2, I went ahead and ordered a Dr. Pepper and a grape cool aid.\nMy food arrived in a timely manner. I could hardly contain myself long enough to take photos before I started devouring this delicious meal.\nEverything and I mean, everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly! The only item that I had never tasted before was the okra and tomatoes. They were delicious. With my order, I also received 4 cornbread muffins. The perfect accompaniment for this meal.\nI couldn't eat everything so I refrigerated the leftovers. After I was done I fell into a deep food coma.\nTony G's gets 5+ stars all day every day. I absolutely recommend this place to anyone passing through the San. Antonio area."", ""It really wanted to come here for the fried chicken. It was really good but I definitely had better. There was not a lot of batter but it was crispy and moist. The mac and cheese was done well and I liked that a lot. The mash potatoes weren't anything to write home about. The gumbo was good; I thought it was flavorful. The best thing I liked about the food here was the cornbread. That was really good. Unfortunately, the service was very slow, even though we came off peak hours at around 2-230pm on a weekday. It took a long time for them to bring us drinks and then to come back and even take our orders. But I would come again if I was in that side of town."", 'Very good Soul Food ! I\'m a North Carolina native that has lived in 6 states and multiple cities,  including GA and Louisiana.\n\nI\'ve been living in SA since 06 and was disappointed in the Soul Food I had tried, ( except Mrs. Kitchen. Haven\'t tried them at their new location, but their original location had great food).\n\nEither way, Tony Gs has AMAZING Oxtail with great portions for the price point, way better than the Jamaican restaurant on Austin Hwy that I used to get Oxtail from.\n\nTony\'s Smothered Pork Chop and the sides I\'ve tried thus far, candied yams, cabbage, real mashed potatoes,okra and tomatoes, are equally good.\n\nThe mac and cheese is disappointing, but everything else I\'ve tried is so good, I forgive them. 😂\n\nI recently tried another popular Seafood/Soul Food restaurant and was very disappointed w/ my Smothered pork chop plate. Portions are smaller and the food isn\'t nearly as good, w/ the exception of their Mac and Cheese . Maybe it\'s because they\'re known as a seafood restaurant ? 🤔\n\nEither way, as a self proclaimed "" Foodie"" from the South, I highly recommend Tony Gs.', ""Tony G's breakfast was so delicious, I plunged into the French Toast and forgot to take a photo. So by the time I remembered, they were half gone. Tony G's has an excellent atmosphere. The service was fabulous, from greeting to getting the bill, the waitress was polite and funny, and the food came out quick and hot. The French Toast was fluffy and sweet, and you could taste the cinnamon (and no eggy taste). The eggs and bacon were cooked to perfection as well. If you're looking for a breakfast or brunch spot, their menu is simple with a Texas/Louisiana variety of tasty food! Hint: The locals love this place!""]"

There were 2 male staff members that for a little bit were attentive and the food came out generally fast. We got the chips and dip which was yummy and they even gave us extra chips which was nice. Our steak was pretty undercooked but as medium rare lovers we didn’t mind. It was after the steak came out that the service really declined. The waiter didn’t check in on us again and he passed us directly several times. We waited about 20 min to be noticed but the waiter never even looked our direction. We finally went up to the bar and awkwardly waited at an edge to get the check and carrot cake. I noticed other people waiting for their check too and the waiter seemed overwhelmed even though there really wasn’t that many people. He never even apologized for ignoring us or making us wait.

The in person menu was completely different from Google\'s online one, and I\'ve attached the picture of the ""rare"" tenderloin I received. Absolutely flavorless, even adding salt could not save this dish. Mashed potatoes tasted like bland mush too.

Don’t forget, you also have a few other great options nearby if you need to walk around before making a dessert decision!\n\nOnly thing that has changed was the pressure of the waiter making us feel like a number and a tip more so than a customer enjoying a sought-after spot at a favored restaurant.

The Taro root that accompanied was welcomed as well.\nThe lobster bisque was just ok.\nThe prime rib had a nice flavor and was cooked to perfection and very tender. For a 14 ounce, you do get full. The mac was disappointing, lacked creaminess and was bland. The sizzling mushrooms were a little bland as well.

Salad bar has enough variety, and if steaks are too rare for your personal taste, you can always ask a different doneness. I'm more of a medium-well steak person, so once I asked for it, they started bringing me everything else like that without even asking.

Plenty of outdoor seating.  (We sat inside since it rained earlier.)  The line moved quickly and the food came out fast.  Only regret is I ordered the lunch portion-burger for $10 which is smaller but comes with fries.  It was so good I wish I had the regular burger!  But can't beat the price for the quality and taste.  My boss said the nachos are amazing, too!  Adding them to my next order. 😋  And they have Blue Bell ice cream..."", 'Ordered both fish and shrimp tacos for lunch and they were superb. The blue tortillas are really unique compared to other taco places and it really stood out. I would recommend 3 tacos per person if you have a good appetite. They give a decent amount of fish and shrimp in the tacos which is nice, a real change from taco places that load toppings with a little bit of protein. The salsas given were also really delicious and paired well with each taco 😋\n\nThere were a lot of places to sit outside with misting fans for the hot weather, and an entire indoor seating setting as well. It was all very clean and I really liked the garden they had going on outside.', ""I had a bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries & a ginger ale. I sat outside under the shade. I was here in the afternoon, and It was a very chill environment. The food was delicious, and I really like that the burger & fries weren't oversalted.

The Rubin sandwich was good; extra sauce available. Definitely recommended!!', 'Worst experience EVER!!! Sat us outside even though our reservation stated inside. We were finally greeted by a stoned waitress after 15 minutes. Our appetizer a simple guacamole and chips took an entire hour and was brought out by the manager. (Yes, I timed it!) Waitress asked “how was everything?” Before we even got our food!!! High as a kite no doubt. House salad came out old, warm and wilted. Bees flying in my cubin sandwich that was cold, dry and barely had any meat. Drinks took forever and were brought out by the bartender herself while waitress was doing God knows what because the restaurant was not busy at ALL and my frozen margarita sat so long it was melted. Asked for kid’s lemonade for our 5 year old which was brought in a tall glass, had to remind her twice until she finally brought a kids cup WITH the check.

We ate outdoors which was hot but made it possible to get in on our schedule, so we didn\'t mind. They kept us well hydrated with cold water. The service was attentive and pleasant from the hostess to our server to all who supported the server in bringing out food. The appetizers were creative and visually appealing though the flavors of the oysters and hamachi didn\'t stand out very much. The bacon/pork belly(?) bits were my favorite part I think.\n\nThe short ribs and mashed potatoes were delicious but the mushrooms seemed to have too strong of a flavor and I didn\'t appreciate the horseradish in the sauce but that\'s my personal preference. My friend found it delightful.\n\nFor dessert, the butter cake was lovely both in flavor and presentation. I\'d definitely like to have a full portion next time (I tried my friend\'s). The lavender cheesecake was pleasant. I don\'t usually enjoy flower flavors, but I enjoy cheesecake, blueberry and lemon curd, so I decided to risk it. The presentation was delightful, the lavender didn\'t dominate, but the cheesecake flavor didn\'t pop for me, so it was good but not great for me.\n\nReally a pleasantly situated restaurant with many highlights. I will say, I regretted not tipping more. I was a bit rushed and calculated slightly low for what I think was warranted for the situation and experience. Still well over ""minimum"" but just didn\'t think it through, so apologies to the servers on that.']"

The cocktails were tasty, my hubby said his margarita was “soft” on the alcohol. It was crowded and our table kept getting “bumped”, but I guess that’s expected.  The seafood enchiladas could be better if the “mole sauce” didn’t over power the rest of the flavors.  The shrimp& grits were fantastic!

Honestly the steak wasn't the best I ever had but it was pretty good...I just prefer a little more seasoning. The cheesecake is a must have even if you take it home for later. My Manhattan with an s were yummy. May have had 3 or 4 if I weren't driving myself.  It was a bit loud for my nerves but that's not necessarily the restaurants fault.

Would come here again if ever in the area again.', ""Smoke Sky Bar offers absolutely delicious food, just like what you'd have fresh off the grill in your own backyard. The indoor sports bar is stunning, and the view from the upstairs mezzanine is breathtaking. The Sky Bar is cozy and ideal for any party. I loved the food, the drinks, and the amazing view of the San Antonio skyline."", ""Great for going with friends or even family to catch a game, for good music or just to spend some fun time together. A very casual place that's great for anyone to come and spend time or just to try the food!\n\nVery outdoorsy and sports / party focused it's a pretty spacious area outside with plenty of seating and large screens as well as a live DJ. There was some seating inside but it was only 2 tables so it's best to go and expect to sit outdoors under coverings; despite being mainly in the outside elements the place is kept spotless so don't let looks or expectations deceive (the outdoor bathrooms are ok but nothing perfect yet they didn't seem dirty just most likely weathered and aged). During warmer months I'm sure it's a lot better and more active while during the colder season (which is when we went) it wasn't a active and there were barely any people. A lot more orders were take out vs dining in so if you like a festive and active environment compared to one that's more slow and mellow I'd recommend dropping by during maybe spring or summer. Despite the cold weather, they did have heaters that they turned on in areas so that people could stay warm and still enjoy the game. We did eat indoors however and there was heating inside but it wasn't overly hot, just comfortably warm. Pretty simple design with wooden walls, small tables with stools and a few posters here and there mainly of ads. It serves like a blank canvas of not trying to take away from the experience you make with others during your time there but isn't so bare that it feels run down or anything. While being a tad more on a louder environment, the music and sports keeps the energy up no matter the temp!\n\nThe bbq here was amazing and had a lot of good flavor that can be hard to find at most spaces. The meat stayed tender, juicy and there was a perfect balance of dry rub on the meat. The portions were also nice to share since we weren't really hungry but was still a good filling meal. Bbq sauce was offered and it had a nice sweet but mostly peppery smokey profile to it which I love as it had a nice kick but wasn't spicy. The side items for the beans and macaroni were also pretty good (although I'm pretty picky about what kinds of beans I eat these were surprisingly good and I found myself choosing to eat it more than the macaroni). The brisket was favorite of them all with the wonderful char on the outside and the softness of the inside balancing out the flavors and textures the strongest but the ribs were a strong second. I also love the versatility of being able to add the brisket to make a sandwich (as bread and pickles are an offered side by default) or putting it into the mac and cheese (which I also highly recommend trying if you haven't). A distinct taste and bold flavor yet still not overbearing, the meal was fantastic and I'm sure would make any fan of bbq quite proud.\n\nFriendly and relaxed upon entering. Most items there were self serve so there wasn't too much interaction needing to be done, but they were very welcoming and made me feel at ease figuring out how the place ran and where to leave our trays, get refills, etc. since it was our first time there. A nice and neutral space where you can easily get in and out service without feeling like you're being rushed.\n\nAlthough not a connoisseur or major fan of bbq, I'd love to be able to go back as it's one of the best bbq places I've had here. I strongly recommend anyone in the downtown area of visiting through to give the place a try and to bring friends and family with you to test out the amazing food they have here and enjoy the open space and fresh air.""]"

My wife had the New York 16 oz with a side order of potato au gratin and she also wanted to try the herb and parmesan fries. Her steak was probably the best steak she's ever had so tender and juicy she could have cut it with a spoon and the truffle butter gave it an amazing flavor. The potatos were creamy and tender and not mushy like au gratin potatos can get and the fries were fabulous great flavor and texture.

The seating area out on the river looked very nice, but we were there on one of the hottest days of the year, so we opted to eat indoors with their air conditioning.  It’s an old restaurant (dating back to the 1940s), so it’s not your typical modern restaurant. However, I liked the old school vibes and colorful setting. The food was very authentic, and everyone in our party enjoyed their meals. I had the green chicken enchiladas, which were great.  The margaritas were very tasty. Our server was very helpful and friendly.  Pricing was very reasonable, and we got a great meal for a good deal.  Check Casa Rio out, and I don’t think you’ll be disappointed!', 'Casa Rio offers a wonderful dining experience with good food at a reasonable price. The atmosphere is vibrant and inviting, perfect for a night out or a casual meal by the river. The food itself did not disappoint; classic Mexican dishes were prepared beautifully, full of flavor, and true to tradition. We really enjoyed the enchiladas and tacos—authentic, well-seasoned, and just what we were hoping for.\n\nThe only minor downside was a small hiccup with the seating process. When we arrived, we were told there would be a 20-30 minute wait for a table, which was fair given how busy the restaurant was. The hostess asked us to wait at the bar and mentioned they’d contact us on our mobile when our table was ready. We grabbed a drink at the bar, kept our phone on the table, and settled in to enjoy the atmosphere while we waited.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes, I checked the phone and saw they’d actually texted us 10 minutes earlier to let us know our table was ready. Since we hadn’t realized it was a text and not a call, we’d missed the notification. When I went to the hostess desk, they mentioned that, because more than five minutes had passed since they’d texted, we’d have to go back on the waitlist. I explained that we were expecting a call as mentioned and hadn’t realized the notification would be via text. The staff were understanding and quickly found us a lovely table right by the river, which made up for the initial confusion.\n\nOverall, Casa Rio is a great choice if you’re looking for quality Mexican food in San Antonio. The atmosphere and riverside setting add a lot to the experience, and despite the slight miscommunication, the staff were accommodating and helpful. With a little tweak to the seating communication, it would be perfect!', 'What’s not to love?  Hadn’t been here in ten years, had lunch yesterday and was not disappointed.  The food was excellent, drinks were delicious, and Alexander did a great job taking care of us - a first class experience.  Also, a really neat location on the river.\n\nCasa Rio remains my “first place to go” on the river walk.  Thanks!', 'Excellent restaurant with authentic Tex-Mex food. This place is always packed because the portions are huge, the price is right, the atmosphere is fantastic and great service.  Great to sit on the River Walk or indoors. This is definitely a must do place here. Margaritas huge‼️‼️']"

It’s called “Powerful Stuff” and it’s a seasonal item so call ahead to make sure it’s on the menu!', 'I will get straight to the point, one of the best seasoned/marinated steaks I\'ve ever had.  This is the perfect steak for a foodie that is not a steak purist seeking the most tender waygu or the perfect medium rare.  This one is all about the intense flavor that is not too sweet, like some ""Maui"" marinated dishes. Also had the Fish Tacos, which were forgettable, but can not give this spot less than 5 stars after that top-notch steak.  I look forward to trying the Maui Ribeye at a DMV location to see if there is consistency in the excellence of the dish!']"
Texas de Brazil - San Antonio,4.3,2837,"['Beautiful restaurant. The service at the beginning started smoothly. We prefer our food medium rare.

This is my first time and all I can say is fantastic.  I have eaten in over 50 Brazilian meat buffet over the past 10years.  This was on point.  My favorite meat is lamb, which by far  this establishment cooked it to perfection. After sampling almost all the meats minus the chicken.  I ate lamb the rest of the night.  The beef ribs melted in my mouth.  The filet and other beef were extremely tender.   As a avid reviewer and frequent business traveler, I read reviews to select my travel dinners.  Trust me on this and look at my other reviews, this is a must visit!! If you have any concerns the GM Claudio will make it right.  Well done Claudio to you and your staff!!', ""Pretty standard Brazilian place. More affordable than most especially for dinner. Service was a bit lack luster. It wasn't very busy when we sat down and took 20+ minutes for our server to come to our table. We only know that because we got ubered there and( checked the drop-off time. We will probably come one more time to see if we just came on an off night but so far chama is still the best by far in San Antonio."", ""This place is amazing!!! The atmosphere is very calm. There are areas of separation that create a kind of romantic setting. The drinks are amazing. The wine selection is very good. Majority of the staff is amazing, some of the people bringing the meat don't pay attention to your card color to see if you even want to be served, but overall it's great service. The food at the open bar is always very fresh and well attended to. The overall experience is great for the price"", ""Always one of my favorite places to go. They did have a new (to me) dish. It was like a shrimp curry or something? Honestly I'm not sure but it was really good.""]"

It is such a cute little building right on the river. The outdoor patio area looked like such a nice setting. We sat indoors, on the side with the open kitchen. It’s not a huge place, so tables are close together and it was full the whole time. But even with that, service was fast and efficient the whole time. The staff worked so well together and everything ran so seamlessly. Every member of the staff was warm and friendly from the moment we entered until we left. The food was wonderful!

I usually come to San Antonio for Mexican food, but would happily pass to visit this restaurant again. I’ll be back!', ""Located downtown near the Riverwalk, with nice outdoor scenery.\nFor starters, we selected the mozzarella with garlic toast, as well as the cacio e pepe deviled eggs. I believe we ordered the wrong mozzarella appetizer by accident, as the dish we were expecting wasn't the one we received. In other pictures online, the mozzarella was in a ball and had a creamy center. The one we chose, was melted down and was more chewy and undesirable. I'll give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and say we just chose the wrong dish, because on our way out, we saw another table with the mozzarella dish that we initially wanted.\nThe deviled eggs were great and the star of the show. Very flavorful with a generous garnish of fresh parmesan.\nWe chose 2 entrees: the Campanelle Bolognese and the white truffle radiatore.\nThe bolognese at first glance looked a bit under sauced, but once we dug in, it was just the right amount of meat sauce to pasta ratio. The Mrs. says the dish reminds her of hamburger helper, I guess you can take that statement with a grain of salt. Overall, it was a good dish in my opinion.\nThe white truffle radiatore dish was a little more flavorful and rich.  I also liked the texture of the pasta, as we've never had the radiatore shaped pasta before. Overall a solid dish.\nService was fine. One of the managers came by the tables to converse with the guests, which was nice. We did however feel a bit guilty when she asked if we wanted more bread to go with our unwanted mozzarella. She said it was one of the best things at Tre Trattoria. To each it's own!\n\n3.9/5""]"

Overall, everything tasted amazing and would definitely come here again!', 'Recommended by the hotel staff, and I must say, the food was excellent. Coming from the UK, I was amazed by the steak size – it was huge and reasonably priced. Cooked exactly to my medium-rare preference, the steak came with Parmesan mashed potatoes and broccoli, all for just $38, which was great considering the portion and quality. I also tried the beef noodle dish, which was incredibly tasty. The service was top-notch, with the staff making sure our drinks were always topped up. Overall, for a good steak and a nice atmosphere, I’d definitely recommend this place.', 'Great atmosphere.  Staff was very knowledgeable about the menu. Price for the food was very nice. Make sure you let the staff know that you want a break in between your appetizer and main course because all our stuff came out fast.

My burger al pastor was a bit dry and did not come smothered in onions and cilantro the way I prefer it, but the pineapple did help out a bit. My boyfriend had the asada fries and they were delicious. My favorite thing was my latte, made with corn, but oddly enough I can’t find a coffee menu anywhere online to find the name of it! I hear the ice cream is nice, and I was impressed by their bar selection.\nThat said, there were a few order errors made for our part of 7, as sweet as our waitress was, and the matcha latte was not a hit.

He answered off of my questions, gave great recommendations and explained that he could adjust the sweetness for my taste! I loved my drink! His bartending skills and his hospitality were excellent-the rest of the staff could really take some lessons from him! Saturday night they had a dj that was playing good music, but it really wasn\'t as busy as I had expected.\nTheir pop up paleta bar was lame. At 1120 I went to get a drink and the bartender told me they were done serving. I asked him what time they stop serving and he replied ""now."" There\'s some service education that needs to be worked on since the bar is still a representation of the Thompson.\nThere was also a alot of cockroaches running around on the balcony with open seating.

The Republic of Texas Restaurant,3.7,2432,"[""The building is amazing. Apparently this is one of the historic gems of San Antonio, built in 1892-93, 50 years before there even was a river walk. I hardly saw the inside until the end of our meal when we went to use the restroom. In my short time walking through I did notice how cool the inside is. Very original. Some may also consider it dated, but dated in a very cool and classy old-fashioned way. The bathrooms were far from nice though. They felt line they were last updated in the 60s. Perhaps they can improve those?!? But it did add to the heritage feel!\n\nNow the food was really quite good but the portions were smaller than we expected. When we ordered Supreme Nachos, we expected a large serving that would satisfy our family of 6 (we ordered a few things to share). The portion was so tiny. But divine. Oh it was good.\n\nThe Brisket & Sausage combo plate was amazing too. Again, a smaller portion than we expected, but oh so yummy and hard to share cuz we all wanted more! For the kids we ordered Fried Chicken Strips and Mac & Cheese. Both were super tasty.\n\nWhat disappointed royally was the vanilla milkshake. The chocolate one was ok. Not amazing but passably good. But the vanilla was terrible. It tasted like they took cheap ice cream and blended it with milk. Nothing more. No syrup or vanilla flavouring. It was terrible. We actually complained (and that is not like us to complain) and our server offered to bring another. This complaint was given before we even had our meals. The new shake was brought out after we were finished the meals a good 30-40 minutes later and were about to pay 🤦🏼\u200d♀️. But this time we ordered chocolate up at least we didn't risk another bad one. So food and atmosphere was great. But not shakes!\n\nOur waitress was okay. She didn't go out of her way to serve. Maybe it was because we were on the river walk and not in the restaurant. But overall it was good enough that we would return if we were locals. Seated on the river at night, watching the boats go by was simply magical. Our own boat driver was the one that recommended this restaurant the night before!

That Supreme nachos, absolutely delicious and the fajitas, it was damn good! The beautiful scenic view of the river, people passing through, boat passing through, even we had some minstrel played for us, it was amazingly beautiful!

Will be back for sure!!', 'All our food came out luke-warm to cold, except for the kids meal & the waiter was inattentive. The tripple dipper is not worth the extra $3 from the regular queso.

Clementine,4.7,564,"['One of my top 5 Dining places in San Antonio TX !\nIts owners are accomplished Culinary geniuses!  Reservations I like to say are a must. The food is creative and very tastefully blended. I generally get the Chefs Choice multi served creation. This night the Pork Belly was an absolute 5 Star creation for the most amazing taste 👅 I have ever had. This is the best Pork Belly and number two can barely be seen with binoculars. The seating at the chefs kitchen is great view of the staff at work.\nI must report when it’s 1/2 full or more the acoustics are notably every poor so having a romantic or another kind of conversation at dinner will be a challenge.\nEnjoy !', 'This was our first time here. It was recommended by our credit card.  We got greeted right away and they had our reservation ready. It’s an America restaurant with French infusion and they nailed it. The unique flavors make the experience u forgettable. We got the beets salad with generous portions and surprise ingredients like chocolate. As entree we got the chicken with chimichurri with the apples on the side. And that’s where they dropped the ball. The apples were amazing! Savory blend of squash and apples topped with peanuts makes any dish taste better. On the other hand the chicken was mediocre. Half chicken just pressed against the grill with no presentation; no micro greens or anything to make it more appealing. Disappointed for the $38 price tag. We needed the evening with coffee and desert and the chocolate mouse with vanilla ice cream was a good selection.  Be aware that the plates are family style and that they have an $88 prefix secret options not listed on the menu. Service is ok and it can get overcrowded pretty easy and food takes its time to be served.', 'My husband and I celebrated my birthday at Clementine at everything was fantastic! The Chef was so kind to make my husband “sweetbreads”… which were not on the menu. 😋 The service was spot on and we had such a lovely evening ❤️', 'We were visiting from DC and read great reviews and had high hopes for a pleasant evening. However, immediately upon entering we were hit with jarring noise—so much we had to speak in raised voices the entire evening to hear just half of what the table was saying. We ordered two apps and three sideboards to share as starters. But the waitress brought out the sideboards with the entrees even though it was clear we wanted them as a starter course. The oysters were ok but very sandy and small and the smoked lebneh was the best part of the plate. The flame tart had good flavor but for the price the presentation lacked luster. It goes downhill from there. The eggplant was very bland and the cook was inconsistent—some pieces were under. The squash was both charred and undercooked with the only flavor being spice from the hummus. The cavatelli had good flavor in the sauce but although ricotta based each was a tough giant lump. Of the entrees the scallops were the only one that lived up to a James beard recognition. The risotto was under and crispy and the truffle lacked freshness to give any aroma. The snapper skin was soggy and the base unrecognizable. The $70 10 oz steak was served on a cold plate with no accompaniments. The service was no better than the food and they must know the food was lacking because no one asked how it was. The experience kept going downhill when they double charged us for the wine which was over priced to begin with. We couldn’t get out fast enough. Coming from DC we are all too happy to pay for good food. But at $100 a head this restaurant does not deliver. Don’t let the pictures fool you. Flavor matters and it just wasn’t there.', 'Fantastic. Relaxed atmosphere, for outstanding fresh food. Dario helped us from the beginning explaining the menu and was so prepared and friendly.\nEvery dish was bright and balanced. We focused on seafood and it was fresh and tasty. The fresh tagliatelle pasta was just right. Every sauce in the dishes was rich, without being overpowering.\nThe desserts are worth a special mention on their own. I appreciated the pairing of passion fruit with the bitterness of the cocoa nibs, the smooth creme brûlée paired with crunchy chocolate. My husband’s hazelnut dessert paired with clementines was perfect as well.\nI am so glad I could swing by and we can’t wait to be back.']"

They are my favorite dishes, so i was hoping Paesanos was up to the challenge.\n\nOnce i walked in. I got an eye roll from the bartender. He seemed more interested in chatting with the female coworker at the bar as i sat down. He seemed irritated that i sat down and wanted to order food. I told him what i wanted and wanted to grab a soda. This is a treat to me because my diet recently has been restricted. So the cold welcome was unexepected from an Italian restaurant.\n\nThe Lasgne came fairly quickly. Beautifully constructed. Heated up the right way. The bolognese was not watery or runny. Thick. Like its supposed to be. Ingredients taste quality. The sauce not sweet or tart. The layers a great balance of bolognese and ricotta.\n\nAs my meal was nearly complete, the bartender became slightly more attentive. My drink remained empty. Which was disapointing. The whole thing was a middle ground experience.\n\nThis couldve been an incredible experience. A phenomenal opportunity for the bartender. Outside seating closed for an event, which means more customers at the bar. The chance to upsell me never was offered. Which wouldve built guest check averages. A warm greeting wouldve provided more opportunity for him to have customers providing higher ability for tip generation. However he was more focused on socializing with staff and his daily prep work then his pocket. Had he taken thw opportunity to do those extra little steps, i am sure i would be raving about this place and it would get 5 stars. Instead of me just mentioning the food was perfectly cooked and its a beautiful restaurant.\n\nPros\nBeautiful location on Riverwalk\nPerfectly cooked Lasagne\nWarm hostess\n\nCons\nIrritated bartender', 'My husband and I came for our Anniversary and Lorie was THE best waitress!

I love a nice bakery anyway, but this was one of the best I've found in a while.\n\nMy husband and I walked over from the Crockett Hotel, and it was very easy to get to on foot.

The venue is nice and relaxed with an open feel. I got there around 830, so there was barely a line. But by 9, it went outside. I ordered the egg Benedict. The sauce is very tasty, and the eggs are cooked perfectly. But the bread has a hard crust, so it's hard to cut compared to an English muffin. And the pork was tough, not tender. I would've skipped that dish and should have opted for one of the croissant sandwiches.\n\nI went back a month later and ordered the turkey, cheese, and egg sandwich on the croissant, so good. Infinitely better than the eggs Benedict. I also ordered a Chai latte, some OJ, and their famous tequila almond croissant. The croissant was OK. I won't order that again."", 'Best bakery I have visited in a long time. This is a popular breakfast spot so be prepared to wait in line outside. However, the line moves quickly and gives you ample time to look at all of the masterfully crafted pastries on display. They really have every type of delicious pastry along with many other unique and mouthwatering creations. The conchas and croissants were our favorites but the French toast was also totally out of this world. Despite the line, it was easy to find a table and not too crowded in the dining room. Clean seating area with friendly service. 5 out of 5. Definitely recommend visiting here whenever you’re in San Antonio.']"

The pork belly was also pretty good. The cocktails were solid. The ravioli was quite good but the rigatoni fell flat, the sausage wasn’t filled with flavor and the service was just brutal.

Very fresh Hamachi on a bite-sized tostada.\n2) Kawano farms melon custard with Uni - 1 out of 10. Not. A. Fan. It was a very strange dish.  Didn't care for the combined flavors of melon custard,  trout roe, and Uni. The Uni was overpowered by everything else.\n3) Wagu Butter Biscuit - 4 out of 10. It's a biscuit.  There's not much more to say.\n4) Pork Belly Yakitori - 8.5 out of 10 for me.  I'm a little conflicted because when I read Pork belly Yakitori, I was expecting thick cut pork belly or at least cubes. This was literally a piece of bacon threaded onto a skewer.  It was a very good piece of bacon, but I felt like they set you up for disappointment because of the description.\n5) Black truffle agnolottini - 9 out of 10. This was delicious.  Creamy,  savory, salty, and that hit of umami from the fresh truffles.  I just wanted a hint of spice, and that would have sent it over the top for me.\n6) Snake river Wagyu - 9 out of 10. For the price,  you get very small portions, but those portions are so good.  The steak is buttery and melts in your mouth.\n7) Nutella Creme Brulee - 6 out of 10. It was good but too much of the same flavors (nothing to contrast). If you like Nutella, this may be right up your alley.\n8) Strawberry Yodel - 8 out of 10. This was such an interesting dessert.  It had a strawberry shell, a basil sponge cake, creme fraiche snow, and a strawberry ganache. I really liked the combination of all the different flavors.\nAll in all, it was a flavorful dinner with excellent wait staff.  I'm glad we went, but I'm not sure if I would go back.

The sherry soy, sautéed spinach and pickled ginger complemented, and never overwhelmed the simple perfection of steamed sea bass.\nMain course #2: Ahi tuna. As expected, it was seared perfectly on the outside only.

For food we tried the Yukon Potato Flautas and Chicken Tinga Empanadas both were seasoned and cooked perfectly.\n\nIf you’re looking for great food, potentially excellent service, and a stunning view, Coasterra is a must-visit. I’m already looking forward to my next visit-lunch for shrimp tacos! It was a cloudy day but I imagine the sunset here would be a great sight!', ""Only go here for a drink and the view...it's amazing. The chips and salsa and buttercake are good so get that.The rest of the food and service (from the front desk girls to the servers) are basic and nothing to rave about. They do the bare minimum. The view is fantastic because it overlooks downtown and the bay. Google San Diego and that's what you will see."", 'Dining at Coasterra was a wonderful experience. The food was exquisite, with each dish bursting with flavor. The highlight, however, was the breathtaking bay view. As we enjoyed our meal, the serene waters and stunning sunset created a magical backdrop. Coastera is a perfect blend of culinary delight and natural beauty.']"
Born and Raised,4.5,2823,"[""One of the local steakhouses in San Diego, owned by Consortium Holdings, is a notable establishment. During our recent visit, we were seated upstairs to accommodate our friends with children. The open-air setting, complete with a remarkable bar and heated patio, provides a pleasant ambiance. However, our experience was slightly hindered by the dense fog in San Diego, which disrupted flight operations. Despite this, the restaurant's steaks were exceptionally flavorful and tender, leaving a lasting impression. We complemented our meal with a selection of side dishes that perfectly complemented the meats.\n\nWhile the upstairs dining area offers a unique experience, I personally prefer the downstairs section, where one can witness the skilled servers and mixologists preparing salads and cocktails on their carts. This adds a touch of culinary artistry to the dining experience.\n\nIt is important to note that this establishment is not a typical mom-and-pop steakhouse, and as such, the prices reflect its upscale nature. Patrons should be prepared to make a significant investment when dining here."", ""The decor is striking from the moment we walked in. We came on a Sunday evening of a holiday weekend and it was so busy we couldn't even walk in! By the time we checked in and got seated it was about 25 minutes after our reservation time.\n\nThe food was delicious - exactly what you'd expect for the caliber of steakhouse they aim to be. The service was fantastic, friendly and informative.\n\nTheir wine list felt like it was lacking some more bold, full body wines given the meat focus, but otherwise it was fantastic. The bar and restrooms, floors and one of our tables definitely looked like they'd been well lived and roughed a bit."", 'WOW! One of the best restaurants I’ve ever been to. Service was incredible and everything we ate there was phenomenal. We got the Table side Caesar salad and then for my main course. I also got the table side steak Diane. We also got a variety of appetizers to split among the table, including the bread service, oysters, and meatball. I got one of the non-alcoholic cocktails and someone I was with got the old fashion. They were both amazing. I wanted to get dessert because they all looked great, but we were all stuffed.', ""My husband and I had a lovely anniversary dinner here. The atmosphere was top notch. The staff was excellent and the food was absolutely delicious. They also went out of their way to ensure we had a beautiful anniversary dinner. This is by far one of the best steakhouses we've visited."", 'One of the best steakhouses I have been too.\nThe steak Wellington is a must try 100%.\nWe sat at the roof top bar and it was such an amazing ambience.\nThe steak sampler was also very good.\nThe service was a bit slow but understandable for a busy Sat night.']"

The 1st time I went with a friend and everything was good. 2nd time I went with my family so they could try it, and it was a different experience. The cook was burning the food, we had 2 servers, but started out with 1, so who do we ask for help here? And when we did let them know about the burnt food they didn't seem very concerned and even wanted to still charge for the item we didn't want anymore. We didn't eat it and sent it back so I asked for it to be removed. Server #1 tried to argue that it was part of the entree, and I said no it was a side, I told server #2. See how it's confusing for them, and us....They also have a 5% extra charge on your bill to reflect an increase in menu prices they say, so there's that. Parking isn't great, and it's too expensive for you to risk it turning out bad...your choice though!"", 'Nice surroundings, friendly service, and flavorful blueberry sour cream crepes.  My server offered extra blueberry compote which I used - nice touch & appreciated. Still not enough blueberries. I returned the next day, mainly to try the bacon.  It was excellent.  But the eggs and toast….not so much.  After returning the toast that was burnt on half the side and barely toasted on the other half side of the bread, the second try at the toast was not burnt, but only about half of each slice was toasted.  It seems they need a new toaster.', 'San Diego must! Highly recommend their ultimate Benedict. It’s a nice way to taste all of their Benedict’s on 1 plate.

The food was amazing, so yummy!!!! Would definitely recommend and will return in the future.', 'The food was pretty good here overall- some dishes better than others. My friends really enjoyed their omlettes and pancakes.  I thought my savory crepe was pretty good, but it was marred by the fact that they used sweet crepe batter for a savory spinach crepe. It really should have a batter with no added sugar. I thought the interior design could really use a remodel, as it seems outdated for such a cute modern plaza. The service was pretty good overall- quick, if not super friendly. This is a good place if you want large portions and rich breakfast foods. /']"

The escargot wasn't impressive, and the French onion soup, while it tasted good, wasn't better than anything you can get at a cheaper french bistro. Steak frites was the biggest disappointment - steak was cooked perfectly, but the sauce was overpowering the taste of the steak. Duck truffle fries that came with it were amazing though. The duck was cooked nice, but the veggies that came with it were undercooked and lacking any flavor. The cocktails were not strong at all, and felt like non-alcoholic beverages. As for the service and atmosphere, they were great. This is why I give it 4 stars. Overall, if you are looking for a nice gastronomic experience I would not recommend this place."", 'Great experience. The staff is elegant friendly. Imagine sitting outside and having all your tastebuds satisfied because plate after plate his every flavor in your palette. That’s what this experience was.

Although we did not experience the live performances, we heard they are great and worth the visit.\n\nCafé Sevilla is located in the heart of the Gaslamp Quarter, right on 5th av. It is within walking distance from a great number of hotels, which is very convenient since parking in the area may be a hassle.\n\nMenu is really vast and Café Sevilla seems to aim at a tapas-like experience where patrons order and share a variety of small bites, however though, my feeling is that not all the menu works as tapas but rather as full size servings, so you might want to keep an eye on each dish size depending on the experience you’re aiming at. Anyhow, that will be up to each patron’s tastes and likes, we only had the small paella serving as main course and the grilled octopus as appetizer, both for sharing and they sufficed. However tasty, the food was far from being spectacular, it definitely lacked the Spanish splendor, quality, and taste.  What was a bigtime letdown was the crema Catalana. Not sure what that espresso-infused dessert was, but it was NOT a crema Catalana; it was buttery rather than creamy and the sugar crust was non-existent. Do yourselves a favor and DO NOT have this dessert!!!\n\nFinally, another kind of letdown, was the service. Please, be mindful that no matter how graceful, how smiley, how fun, how polite the waiter is, if the job is not being done well, service is poor: being absent, not keeping the table clean, being unknowledgeable about the food and drinks menus, and letting the plates to pile, is poor service.\n\nWould I recommend this place??? Well, probably… specially if you’re craving for some very specific tapas or any other Spanish dish like paella (and yet be mindful of the aforementioned “buts”), otherwise, you might want to think twice about visiting Café Sevilla, after all, you’re in San Diego.', 'Beautiful place, incredible live music, friendly service of a bit slow when later in the evening.

The food we ordered was a lobster eggs Benedict($27) and a chicken and waffles plate($17). The look of these items were stunning. They certainly have the presentation down. As for the taste, the garnish on the chicken and waffles is unnecessary. In fact, it ruins the taste and quality of the dish. The chicken was nice and moist and the waffle was cooked to expected quality. As for the lobster eggs Benedict, the egg was cooked well. In addition to that I liked the hollandaise sauce they added(this is an important piece of the dish). The lobster was not overwhelming and had a nice complimenting flavor in each bite. Amongst the two, my partner and I agree that the chicken and waffles was better. (3 Stars)\n\nMy overall thoughts are:\n\nIf you want to come here just for the clout, this is the place for you. If you care about the food and service, there are many other places in San Diego to visit. Choose wisely as you may be disappointed here.\n\nOverall 3 stars', ""Awesome restaurant here with tons of options on the menu. Just be prepared to wait for a bit but I promis it's worth it. The atmosphere is nice and open. If you want souffles they got it. I liked the american breakfast. Check it out and enjoy the menu artwork."", 'The chicken in the chicken and waffles was very dry. The sausage gravy helped, but the gravy itself was nothing to write home about. The chilaquiles were basically just chips with a little bit of sauce that was not overly impressive. Maybe it was an off day for them, but we were pretty disappointed after seeing the great reviews. Server was very nice though(:']"

However, we never did get the bread after being asked twice if we would like it. The French onion soup was amazing! Would have enjoyed the salmon wellington more if it was not cut into slices. After all, the best part about wellington is the puff pastry. The rib eye was delicious and tender. The lobster looked fantastic. The brussel sprouts were too charred for my liking.

Trust,4.5,1227,"[""Each dish we ordered : crab fried rice, grilled octopus, and oxtail ravioli , is unique with wonderful complexity.

The decor was well chosen and the layout allowed my date and I to sit next to each other which was a huge plus. Sean our server was awesome. Knowledgeable and attentive. Will seek to be sat in his section again. It was not lost on us that the cocktails were named after local attractions and streets. Great touch. Trust’s old fashioned (Museum of us) was excellent. Can’t remember its name but the gin with lavender  was also fantastic.  We started the meal with Little Gems their salad. Was perfectly dressed. Loved it. We then had the charcuterie board. The acidic offerings cut through the salt. The charred bread was so good. The star of the night was the char siu brisket. 11/10 dish. It had Thai flavors and was perfectly smoked over 36 hours. So yummy.  Wish we had ordered the crab fried rice to go with it. We will next time. Last we had a perfectly grilled octopus. So tender.  But wait. There was dessert. Milk and cookies. A cheesecake blondie with a scoop of what I think was cookie dough ice cream. Decadent. Worth it. Highly recommend visiting. Everything was perfectly seasoned and the attention to detail was consistent.', ""June 2024:\nWe had dinner at Trust for the first time on a Saturday evening. We had reservations and were seated immediately on their outdoor patio which is also dog friendly. The dinner menu is a lot of small plates that are meant to be shared. They recommend 2 plates per person. We ordered the following for dinner: wood grilled cauliflower, oak fired potatoes, crab fried rice, octopus fritters, potato gnocchi, char sui brisket, and hush puppies. And for dessert, we ordered the following: grasshopper cheesecake, whatchamacallit, milk & cookies pie. Literally, everything we ate was delicious! Of the dinner items, I would say the crab fried rice was my favorite and is a must order. The octopus fritters are very much so like takoyaki. They were delicious but if you have had takoyaki before, you could skip this. The hush puppies were very different. They had a good corn flavor and you actually cut them in half to fill with butter and ham. I've never had them this way but it was great. I would say my least favorite of the savory items was the char sui brisket. I love brisket but I found this to be too salty. The desserts were all beautifully plated. The grasshopper cheesecake and whatchamacallit were my favorites. I really like the idea of a milk and cookies pie but the filling had a very odd texture - it felt like it was too set. This was my first time having dinner at Trust and I really enjoyed the meal. This will be one of my go-to places for dinner now. Definitely try it for dinner.\n\nNovember 2022: We had Sunday brunch reservations at 11:15 am for the patio and were seated immediately. The patio is very spacious with heaters and is dog friendly. Make sure to give yourself plenty to time to park because there is no parking lot. The staff were all very friendly, quick, and attentive. We ordered the seasonal sticky bun (salted caramel persimmon), braised bacon grilled cheese, and pork belly poutine. The seasonal sticky bun was amazing. It's quite big so it is a great option for sharing. It came with salted caramel sauce, vanilla ice, persimmons, and oaty crumble. This was definitely a highlight and we would come back again to try another flavor. The braised bacon grilled cheese sandwich was really tasty - the portion size felt perfect (not too big). The sandwich had thick bacon inside of it and the mornay sauce on top made it extra special. The pork belly poutine was good but it felt a little salty and light on the pork belly. One thing to note about the brunch menu is there is a very limited selection of non-alcoholic drinks like coffee and tea. They seemed to only have black coffee - no lattes, chai tea, etc. Overall, we really enjoyed the food, service, and spacious outdoor seating. I would recommend coming here for brunch.\n\nSeptember 2023: We had brunch at Trust on a Sunday at 10 am. We made reservations and were seated immediately outdoors (since we had our dog with us). We got the seasonal sticky bun (cookies and cream), pork cutlet, french toast, and egg white scramble. The sticky bun was served with cookies and cream ice cream and was delicious - it was so warm, soft, and tender with the perfect amount of sweetness. The french toast was incredibly tender and custardy. The egg white scramble was my favorite - it was served with tempura broccoli which was amazing! Our waitress was very friendly and even brought a water bowl and some treats for our dog. Although the parking isn't great here, Trust is still worth the effort because the food is absolutely amazing."", ""We went for weekend brunch and since we had reservations, we were seated immediately.\n\nPros: We had the wood fired cauliflower and chicken sandwich. The wood fired cauliflower was simply delicious with a burst of flavors (tangy, sweet with a little bit of spice). The portion size is particularly small for this dish but we were warned by the waitress beforehand so we knew what to expect. The chicken sandwich was nice and juicy.\n\nCons: For a brunch place, the only coffee option they had was the drip coffee. So if you're looking for a nice cup of latte or espresso or cappuccino, you won't find it here."", 'I am writing with regards to an experience occurring on 10/24/2024 at The Wise Ox Butcher & Eatery -\n\nI am writing to express my profound disappointment with a recent experience at your establishment, The Wise Ox Butcher & Eatery.

Where is the balance and harmony between different ingredients which originally are supposed to be tasteful with different oil level in the same plate? It’s a failure of French cuisine. Even I enjoyed the certain texture of the salmon, and the rest are overcooked. Still consider it’s a failure\nHowever, if you like American fast food, their food won’t bother your tongue too much. Rich dance and bounce of oil and salt will bring you the privilege about how American food culture could make French food not taste like French any more\nThe service is pretty nice!', 'Leticia & her crew, namely Jenny & Anthony, (albeit a true team made brought it all to life, from start to finish) were absolutely outstanding.

I definitely would recommend!', 'Another spot that’s been on my list for years.

Ciccia Osteria,4.7,639,"['Super cute relaxed place perfect for a solo meal, date or dinner with friends.

We shared one appetizer from the special offer of the day (zucchini), lasagna and orzotto (with a substitute for pearl barley). To be honest, it was a lot (we are not very big eaters).

Great place to bring a date or go out for a family dinner!', 'We recently arrived in San Diego and couldn’t wait to try Ciccia Osteria after hearing so many great things about it and it definitely delivered!\n\nThe meal started off with a special treat: the octopus salad. It was simply outstanding, with perfectly cooked octopus that was tender and full of flavor. Another highlight of the starters was the mushroom flan, which was a unique dish that brought rich, earthy flavors to the table.\n\nFor the main course, we decided to sample a variety of their pastas, and we were not disappointed. The gnocchi with crab was exquisite, the squid ink pasta had a delightful depth of flavor, and the frutti di mare was bursting with fresh seafood. Each dish was a testament to the skill and authenticity that Ciccia Osteria brings to Italian cuisine.\n\nTo finish off, we indulged in two desserts: the apricot habanero cheesecake and the classic tiramisu. Both were absolutely delightful, with the cheesecake offering a surprising but perfectly balanced kick, and the tiramisu capturing all the traditional flavors we love.\n\nIt’s not easy to find a place that offers such authentic Italian food, but Ciccia Osteria is a true gem. San Diego is incredibly lucky to have this spot. We’ll definitely be returning to savor more of their menu.', ""My wife and I made a reservation online, via their website and it worked perfectly. We showed up, they received us with a great attitude and made us feel at home. The food is definitely amazing. It is expensive but at least for us, I don't mind paying my hard earned money when the food is delicious and get treated with respect. I recommend this place for sure but It keep in mind that it is expensive! The only downside is Parking can be an issue but that has nothing to do with the restaurant. Overall amazing!""]"

We thought it was good, but probably won't order it next time.\n\nOverall our experience was great!  The staff was super attentive and extremely friendly.  They even wrote a little note on the menu congratulating us on our 2 year wedding anniversary."", 'I had the “Chefs Tasting” when they brought a guest chef in to cook that particular menu, so take what I say with a grain of salt. It was okay. Everything was cooked well but the flavor was not what I would expect or even desire for as pricey of a dinner as this. The wine pairings were perfect, however. I suggest getting the normal menu and not doing the tasting even though it’s a better deal.']"

Although the food was good enough to eat, I hoped for some garlic flavoring or something to enhance the succulent lobster I was served. Yes, my steak had a nice char on it, yet for a medium cooked steak, it was a tad overcooked, I found that the steak and cheesy bacon potatoes lacked flavor; additionally, the cheese in the cheesey potatoes was not melted.\n\nIn handling our leftovers, we were given a to go box and bag to pack it up ourselves.

Thanks Meg for a positive experience.', ""The reviews were generally really great, so we ventured over here from our hotel to celebrate our 20th anniversary.\nWe were a little surprised by the ambiance and vibe of Greystone. It was almost like it didn't know who it was. Pricing and menu options like a high-end steakhouse but then decor and setting more like an awkward teenager.\nThe building has a ton of history, some sordid, but some really cool. With the menu, it seems like they would have better honored the traditional, historic nature of the building and lean into that. However, it's sort of the oddly sordid vibe that comes out, especially after reading the buildings history. Anyway, I digress.\nOur server was nice but didn't seem to focused on actually serving us, but more of on programming the new handheld devices to include all the menu items and convince the rest of the servers to start using them. Not what I would have expected from a high-end place. He didn't give us any menus. We had to ask, and then he only brought one at a time - wine, whiskey/scotch, then finally food. The menus have seen better days. They did give us a nice anniversary card with some rose petals on the table, which was a very nice touch. Though it was clear the card was reused from the smudges and fingerprints on it. The server next to our table was top-notch though - knew the menu, knew the wine selection, and was attentive.\nThey had a strong wine collection but very few selections in the mid-range ($100). Again, I didn't like up with the vibe of the place.\nThe menu had some delicious steaks on it, as well as other fish and chicken options. We both had filets and enjoyed them. The steak was seasoned very nicely and cooked beautifully, so I don't think I needed to buy a topping (grilled onions for my wife and bordalaise for me) after all. We ordered traditional mashed potatoes (excellent) and street corn (good) as our sides. We opted to skip dessert just because we felt so odd at the place and kind of wanted to get out of there.\nFor the price ($300+ with tax and tip), we expect more. Our evening was a 5 or 6 out of 10, unfortunately, but at least we tried a new place."", 'Joey’s the best! Excellent food. Excellent service.

He ignored us and left us sitting and wondering where our bill was for 30 minutes.

I needed a special restaurant to celebrate a special occasion and Asti was the first restaurant that came up for my Restaurants. Com gift card. A last minute reservation on a Thursday evening was no problem.\n\nAsti has a prime location on 5th Avenue in the Gaslamp District in downtown San Diego. Parking is difficult, especially since 5th Avenue is now a pedestrian boulevard and closed to cars. I circled the area twice, then gave up and found paid parking at Horton Plaza. I was nervous because I couldn\'t calculate the charge, but it ended up to be a reasonable $16.\n\nWe chose to sit inside instead of the large outdoor patio on the street in front of the restaurant. The inside was empty with only 2 other tables of diners. More people were dining outside, but the restaurant was alarmingly empty for a usually busy Thursday evening. It made me a but nervous but I was determined to give Asti a chance. I\'m so glad we did.\n\nAsti is an old school fancy Italian restaurant. It has a charming ambience and a lovely decor dominated by two huge murals on either side of the space. I didn\'t care for the silk flowers on each table...a few stems of an inexpensive flower on each table would be a huge improvement at minimal cost. I also didn\'t care for the slightly too loud modern music. They should play Italian opera or Frank Sinatra.\n\nThe menu was formally presented in a heavy binder, just like the old days. I missed this so much during and after Covid. There was an insert listing specials without any prices. I have been burned by this before and asked how much the appetizer we were considering was. The burrata with heirloom tomatoes and procuitto was $25. I think that\'s an expensive appetizer, but it was very good. The first time I\'ve had such delicious tomatoes in years.\n\nA bread basket with butter was provided at no charge to start our meal. The bread was warm and very good. We also enjoyed a large Pelegrino.\n\nI had the gnocchi with Alfredo Sauce and my guest had the spaghetti with meatballs ($28 each). I usually order the gnocchi if it\'s on the menu and this was the best gnocchi I\'ve ever had. My guest enjoyed his dish. Portions were generous enough that we both took leftovers home.\n\nWe considered dessert, but decided we were full.\n\nDinner was $100 for an appetizer, 2 entrees and  the large Pelegrino. A good value for an excellent meal.\n\nService was friendly although a bit casual for a ""fancy"" restaurant. Diners were not dressed up at all. I think they should have been.\n\nThe women\'s bathroom was beautifully decorated. One of the nicest restrooms I\'ve been in. The paper towel dispenser wasn\'t working though. I informed the bartender.\n\nI highly recommend Asti. The waitress said it was unusually empty.

It is a small establishment and unfortunately for us there was a huge party directly behind us with children who were loud, boisterous and kept getting up and running around. The parents did nothing to discipline them which was  unfortunate for us. Otherwise it would have been a great evening. I would still recommend this restaurant because the food was delicious.']"

Be sure to make a reservation way out in advance to ensure this experience.\n\nFrom the moment you arrive, you'll appreciate the ease of parking—just make sure to read the instructions on their website beforehand. We had no issues parking across the street in the Insurance guys parking lot and just paid for 2 hours of parking via the APP. They do offer valet service during the evenings, which is a nice touch.\n\nThe restaurant beautifully engages all your senses with its visually stunning seating areas and captivating displays, including a massive wall showcasing preserved foods in various jars. We were seated at a comfortable bench-style table for four outside with greenery growing all over the lattice for a sense of privacy perfect for our two-hour full-service dinner.\n\nEven the menu is an experience in itself, filled with beautiful artwork and vibrant colors that make choosing your meal a delight. Take some time and enjoy looking this menu over! Lots of choices. This was my second time dining here, and I just had to reorder the Polpo Crocante with Romesco Sauce—crispy octopus served with a rich red pepper and almond sauce. My husband opted for the Carpaccio di Manzo—thinly sliced tenderloin beef, rubbed with espresso, porcini mushrooms, and garlic, then topped with black summer truffles. Both appetizers were perfect for our party of four.\n\nThe dinner menu is versatile, letting you choose your pasta type and sauce, with additional add-ons available—truly something for everyone. They also offer a few daily specials, but the regular selection is already fantastic. The service is spot on and never even missed a detail! Our table ordered the Gnocchi Porcini e Gamberi Tartufati (gnocchi with porcini mushrooms, shrimp, and truffle), which was served in an authentic copper saucepan brought right to the table. My niece ordered the Paccheri alla Scampi, which came with a whole langoustine (a type of small lobster) on top of her pasta. Super fun and added some extra pop to the dish. My husband opted for Spaghetti allo Scoglio, a seafood pasta featuring a mix of clams, mussels, and shrimp. I enjoyed all the authentic miss matched Italian pottery they use at the table. Very eclectic and also keeps the experience not too formal.\n\nWe chose a bottle of white wine called Sandone from Italy, which paired perfectly with the seafood and pasta dishes everyone was ordering. The waiter bought over silver bucket with ice to keep the wine chilled, making the table service feel even more classy and old world.\n\nWith such a delightful dining experience, I couldn't resist ordering dessert, knowing everything was handmade. I chose the Tiramisu, which was prepared tableside by our waiter. Watching the process was almost as enjoyable as tasting it: homemade vanilla ladyfingers, freshly poured espresso soaking into them, all layered with freshly made mascarpone cream, and topped off with a dusting of freshly grated cocoa powder. The flavors were simply amazing—every bite was a perfect blend of textures and tastes.\n\nTo top off our evening, our waiter surprised us with an adorable Polaroid picture of our table, a delightful keepsake that added a personal touch to an already memorable meal. Cesarina doesn’t just offer dinner; it delivers a full, immersive experience that transports you straight to Italy. Highly recommended!""]"

The drinks themselves were ok.  A bit later we noticed we hadn’t seen our waitress for a bit and wanted to get another round in before it hit 6pm.  We finally caught her eye and she came over and we let her know we wanted some additional drinks before happy hour ended.  She took the order and brought us the drinks about five minutes later.  After we finished the second round we wanted to head out to another bar and had trouble getting our waitresses attention so I eventually went up to the bar where she was chatting with other workers.  She proceeded to print out the bill and it was full price instead of 51% off. When I asked why we didn’t get the half off she stated it was only for certain beers and alcohol drinks.   I was in disbelief given we had specifically mentioned we were there for the happy hour and she made no mention that the drinks we were ordering were not included in the deal. That was shady as hell.  We won’t be going back there. I’m giving them two stars only because the drinks were ok. Be careful what you order if you’re going during happy hour.']"

It was succulent, well-seasoned, and perfectly cooked, demonstrating the kitchen's high culinary standards.\n\nDining at Fearing’s was an absolute pleasure—great food, attentive service, and a friendly atmosphere. It’s a prime example of Dallas’s fine dining scene, and I would urge anyone looking for an exceptional meal to give it a try."", ""I had a wonderful experience at Fearing's. My wife and I came here for restaurant week 2024 and everything we ordered from the special menu was superb. The soup was poured table-side and was very tasty. The tuna tataki provided a unique Southwest take on  a Japanese classic. My wife ordered the striped bass and I had to hold myself back from licking the plate clean after tasting the sauce. The antelope was beautifully presented and brought together a wonderful assortment of\nSouthwest flavours. And the banana pudding... I'll never look at one the same again. and above all else the staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating to our dietary restrictions. Please make an effort to visit this restaurant if you are in Dallas. You will not be disappointed!"", 'I visited Fearing’s during restaurant week and was blown away by the restaurant. The atmosphere is perfectly Dallas, and the southwest menu is unique and delicious. We also had the opportunity to meet chef Fearing, and he was so friendly and was the cherry on top of our dining experience. The antelope is a must try and the banana pudding was delicious as well!', 'So we tried it and it is just 🔥🔥🔥🔥\nWe ordered the seasonal 3 course meal and we also did wine pairing.\n\nJust amazing. My first time trying steak and boom I fell in love. We got the chefs special appetizer, chicken tacos, tortilla soup, antelope steak, and for dessert we got the signature banana pudding with Bignets.\n\nThe steak was impeccable, the creamy sweetness of banana pudding paired with the soft warm freshly baked cinnamon sugar coated bignets was such a delight to eat.\n\nI just wanna visit the restaurant again!']"
The Henry,4.4,2463,"[""We came on Saturday for brunch and wow what a beautiful restaurant! The patio is a nice spot to dine at on a nice day, especially for brunch. Our server was nice, buuut the service was really slow. It took 20 minutes just to get a cocktail and the food took a while, once we got the food some of it you could tell wasn't fresh as if it had been sitting for a while. Both my Pomegranate Hibiscus Spritz and The Cleo latte were amazing 10/10! The Cinnamon Swirl French Toast was so delicious 9/10, but the 2 Egg Breakfast was very average and not fresh 6/10. The California Bowl was pretty okay, 7.5/10. Overall I do think this place is overpriced and the food is very average, I'd only recommend for the drinks really."", 'This place is amazing, the service is excellent Alana?, did an awesome job taking care of us.\nThe short rib dumplings are a must, the hot honey chicken sandwich is so good. My fave is the Korean sears steak.  And this place has the best key lime pie on the whole planet', ""Sat at the rooftop bar for Sunday brunch. The atmosphere here is top notch! My new favorite spot. Had coffee and the California Burrito Bowl with breakfast potatoes. Food came out super quick. Coffee was great. Burrito Bowl was amazing! Not enough salsa came with it so I'll ask for extra next time. The breakfast potatoes were terrible (perfectly crispy on the outside but dry and almost powderlike inside). I saw a variety of pretty cocktails being served and everyone looked pleased with the drinks. The bartender was fantastic and very attentive.\n\nParking is a breeze. The Union Parking Garage elevator lets you at right at the plaza where the Henry and other restaurants are located. They validate 2 hours of parking. I was in and out in 45 minutes."", 'The food, ambience, and wait staff were all excellent here! Our server, Cody, was very attentive and gave great food recommendations! My boyfriend and I were visiting from Atlanta and dined here on a weekday at 2pm and parked on the street for just $1. This was a perfect time, but being such a large establishment, I imagine any time would be great. We indulged in 3 appetizers - (1) short rib potstickers: which was sitting in a delicious Asian sauce; (2) jumbo lump crab cake: which had a nice crispy exterior and a refreshing yet subtle lemon flavor throughout; and (3) their homemade recipe of pretzels + fondue: which had the ideal ratio of salt to bread, kept its softness throughout our entire meal, and was a very shareable portion. Then, for entrees I had the shrimp taco platter which was the perfect mix of sweet, citrus, and grilled flavors. And, my boyfriend had the skirt steak (cooked medium) which was so tender and well seasoned that it is easilyyyy a competitor against all steakhouses around! The Henry was definitely an all-around 10/10 experience!!', 'Our party of 12 made a reservation weeks in advance for a double birthday celebration, and we were assured we would have rooftop seating. Upon arrival, we were initially told that due to earlier rain, we could only sit inside. However, the weather had cleared up, and the manager quickly accommodated us by seating us outside.\n\nWe were not informed when making the reservation that there was a limit of 4 checks per party, which meant that all 12 people (5 couples and 2 individuals) would have to split the bill and repay each other. Had we been made aware of this policy beforehand, our group would have been better prepared. Additionally, we were not told that the rooftop seating had a limited menu. The manager did make an exception and allowed us to order from the full menu.\n\nAs our dinner was at sunset, we found ourselves without sufficient lighting. We had to gather lanterns from other tables to illuminate ours. The manager noticed this and personally provided additional tabletop lighting.\n\nOur server was very sweet, but given the size of our party, she could have used some assistance. The pacing of our meal service was slow. My salmon didn’t seem cooked to the extent I asked so I had to leave much of it on the plate. The appetizers, however, were delicious. The oysters were divine, and the pretzel bites were enormous. They served great drinks with heavy pours.\n\nOverall, the event could have been smoother, but we appreciated the efforts made by the staff that night. However, there could have been better communication and proactive measures taken, considering the size of our party and the reservation made in advance. The staff did make a nice gesture by bringing cute desserts for the birthday guests, which we appreciated.\n\nImportant: For parties over 12 people, they require a minimum spend and a single check. For parties under 12, they limit you to 4 tabs. Be aware of these policies before you arrive.\n\nPro Tip: To avoid any unexpected surprises, call and speak to the manager on duty on the day of your reservation.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b']"

But everything else was a pleasent culinary experience. I will come back to try the crab cakes and dessert.', 'Beautiful place for anniversary date night! Micheal was our server and he did an excellent job making our dinner memorable.\n\nIt was quite expensive but worth the price. The dry beef steak was juicy and tender! Paid a total of $260 for 2 meals and 1 dessert.\n\nIt was free valet parking!', 'The taste and atmosphere of the food are comparable to Michelin restaurants. The chef uses salt stones as part of his hometown spirit. The ceviche was fresh, and the sauce was full of a little sweetness and sourness. The squash bruschetta-like dish was a little different from the traditional style, but the combination of feta cheese and well-simmered cherry tomatoes was good. The texture of the bread was also good, not soggy. The king salmon was soft and juicy, and the wagyu beef was melt-in-your-mouth soft. My young daughter also enjoyed it very much. The peach dessert had a crispy crust, and the combination of sweet peach and refreshing sherbet was the perfect dessert. The server was always on standby, and she was meticulous in checking if there were any allergies. Parking seemed a little difficult unless you use valet.']"
Kenny's Wood Fired Grill,4.7,3495,"['This place is phenomenal for its ambiance, food, and service! My wife and I came here for dinner with her co-workers on the recommendation of her supervisor, who had been here before.\n\nGiven the strong recommendation, I was thoroughly impressed. Our reservation was right on time, even though we arrived 10-15 minutes early. They were very precise with the timing, so it’s important to arrive promptly. The place was buzzing with people having a great time, and the bar was packed with no empty seats in sight.\n\nThe noise level was above average due to the lively conversations around us. Once our table was ready, they seated us in the back right corner near the kitchen entry and the hallway to the bathrooms. Surprisingly, this was the best spot in the restaurant as it was quiet, with no one directly behind or beside us. We had a peaceful dining experience, able to enjoy our meal and conversation in privacy.\n\nOur waiter was fantastic! He walked us through the menu and introduced us to the complimentary bread, which was shaped like a mushroom. It was light, and with the butter, absolutely delicious.\n\nMy wife’s supervisor recommended the pork chop, and she wasn’t wrong! It was thick, juicy, and beautifully seared. I paired it with a loaded baked potato, minus the sour cream. The pork chop was perfectly seasoned and didn’t need any extra condiments. To my surprise, I finished the entire chop and the side with ease.\n\nI also ordered an Old Fashioned, and while I was initially disappointed that they used a lemon peel instead of an orange peel, my wife’s supervisor reminded me that recent hurricanes in Florida affected the orange supply. I had forgotten about that, totally my mistake! In the end, I still enjoyed my whiskey.\n\nThe restaurant was conveniently close to our stay at the Marriott in Addison and just down the road. While we could have walked, we chose to drive due to the busy frontage road. Although the private parking lot was full, we managed to find a spot close to the entrance.\n\nI would highly recommend this place, whether you’re in town on a business trip or planning a date night with your significant other.', ""A classy restaurant with a great vibe. We've come here with coworkers at least 3 times, and we consistently have great experiences. The restaurant is usually full, so it is best to make reservations.  The place is a bit dark but it has a good ambience, and service is fairly quick. The staff wear very neat uniforms"", ""This was my first time coming here. It was a very intimate setting. The waitress Krystal was very professional friendly and attentive. I love that they have positive messages on their napkins. The food was absolutely delicious.

I will definitely be going back here to try something else."", ""Kenny's Wood Fired Grill is one of the best restaurants in DFW.  Classy and Great Atmosphere.   The Service is excellent!

I had Chicken Fried Steak with bacon and eggs this year. Delicious! Recommend.\nGluten-free options are available."", ""We came here on a Wednesday night after 8PM and the entire place was packed - which was a good sign! The bar was full, but luckily we had a reservation and got to our table within 5 minutes. They specialize in martini's here so we tried a couple different ones and Wow! Definitely could see why almost every table had one. We decided to get the 16oz NY strip with adult mac and cheese & also the potato cakes. The steak here is phenomenal! What really blew me away from our experience though is the service. Our server was the absolute star of the show. I've never had someone bring a frosty martini glass every half hour to help keep my cocktail cold - that extra step he took really was the cherry on top. We plan on coming back again mostly based off the service but the martinis & steak are a delicious plus!""]"

We ordered the hand cut fries to share and they came out crispy and hot! My mother also enjoyed her D.C.C. burger and added fresh jalapeños and a fried egg!\n\nWe’ll definitely return in the future!', ""We went to this place because we love burgers and this was a new place to try. The burgers were good, the sweet potato fries and regular fries were great and service was impeccable. There is a section with booths in the back while we sat in the front on wide long tables on bar stools. If you want to visit with somebody and have conversation and relax while you drink your beer... choose a booth. Outdoor patio dining is available with mist to cool you down. Nice clean operation with plenty of parking although if you go at a time when there is a big group partying, the parking may get tricky.\n\nService was good with knowledgeable staff and food came quickly. That is always a nice touch.\n\nMusic was not too loud. Bluesy music on the night we were there added to the ambience.\n\nThey had a McDonald burger vs McKamala burger contest on. McDonald burger had 2 to one lead and McDonald a clear winner by a lot. I ordered a McDonald after a switch from 'Hot Bastard'. Burger was great. The other burger was Mother Blues and was also good.\n\nThe namesake Rodeo Goat 🐐 mascot is prominently on display.\n\nIf you like burgers and traditional American style food you will like this place and with a big selection of burgers you are bound to find one that will tickle you tastebuds to the max.

Dragonfly,4.5,576,"['The food was yummy. I always wanted to try this place out, and I really enjoyed it. The environment was welcoming and friendly.

The blue crab linguine could have done without the sprouts on top, but otherwise, it was also yummy.', 'We tried the cheeseburger and the ahi tuna poke bowl, and both were delicious, but the poke bowl was exceptional. The tuna was perfectly seasoned. I didn’t have high expectations for the food, but I was genuinely impressed. I really enjoy having lunch here. Plus, the staff was incredibly friendly and attentive.', ""Amazing service and beautiful decor, but I've never had such a bland dish. I ordered the spicy crispy chicken and mashed potatoes. The potatoes tasted like they were whipped with water and the chicken had no seasoning besides a sprinkle of chili on the outside. It was absolutely plain but it wasn't bad, not worth going for that specific dish at least. The green beans were the most flavorful thing on the plate."", ""Cute spot inside Hotel Zaza.\n\nFood:\nDeviled eggs - very small, but tasty. There were three types: prosciutto, caviar, regular. At $16, I wish either the eggs were larger or that there were more of them\n\nSpicy chicken sandwich - decent sized sandwich. Not spicy at all. Mine had little taste. The pickles were the highlight of the sandwich. I still ate it\n\nCesar salad - tasty. No complaints\n\nFries - crispy and delicious\n\nDrinks:\nZaza Pink Lemon Drop - tasty. Only complaint is that at $20, I didn't expect it to be made with Tito's. Was still good\n\nBrown sugar Old Fashioned - delicious. No complaints\n\nThe service was great. We received recommendations on what to order. She was super friendly too. Unfortunately, I forgot her name so I couldn't add it to the review."", 'Dragonfly restaurant, nestled inside the ZaZa Hotel, offers a quaint dining experience but fell short of expectations for our party of eight. The service was attentive. Unfortunately, the drinks didn’t impress; my spicy margarita was underwhelming, and no one in our party ordered a second round.\n\nThe evening started on a high note with delicious appetizers—Brussels sprouts, lamb chops, and Parmesan fries. However, my main course of medium-rare steak was a disappointment. The steak was overly chewy and I couldn’t finish it. The portion sizes were peculiar, with options of 4 or 6 ounces—4 ounces amounted to just a few bites. Additionally, the mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box, and the asparagus was tough. Comparatively, LongHorn Steakhouse offers better steaks at a lower price.\n\nOne colleague had sliders with a Caesar salad, which she rated as just okay, while another friend enjoyed her chicken dish. The highlight of the meal was the warm brownie sundae, which ended the night on a sweet note.\n\nOverall, Dragonfly didn’t quite meet my expectations. For a more satisfying experience, I’d likely choose The Capital Grille a few blocks away.']"

My wife had a lobster roll and corn from The Dock it was good but on the pricier side. After that, we had some ice cream at The Spun Cow. I had Gooey Cheesecake with Reeses Pieces topping in a waffle bowl. They made the waffle bowl right there. It was still warm. We went at night and everything is lit up in color changing loghts.

Monarch Restaurant,4.3,1221,"[""First time eating at this restaurant. And I can honestly say I'll definitely be going back.

They charge you $125pp at the time of the reservation but it goes towards your final bill. And you're going to spend at least that on the dinner anyways so it's no big deal.

Maybe it’s because I‘ve eaten too many lobsters and I’m very picky about lobsters now.

The rice was supposed to be cilantro rice, but instead was something that looked and tasted like a boxed yellow rice.  The veggies were fresh.  The fish was not blackened but covered with Louisiana style seasoning and cayenne.  I added the phot of the current menu the day we visited and the photo of what I received. I paid $44 for that.\nI ordered a French 75 that was okay.  The Guinness my husband ordered had too much foam on the top.  We were going to order the Irish bread pudding dessert that boasted coconut ice cream and a Jameson whiskey sauce, but decided not to because we didn’t want to be as disappointed as we were with the food. My husband got fish and chips.  He liked the coleslaw, but the fish looked too small to be cod and tasted sweeter than cod.  The service was good. Wouldn’t recommend.', ""This place is terrific! Whether you're entertaining clients or treating coworkers, it's an excellent choice.

Pigeons outside are having a blast, and the bathroom well...it\'s one of those times when you think to yourself ""I\'ll just do it at home"". Ordering drinks is a pain... So yeah, food is great, just not everything else', 'Pecan Lodge is a standout gem in the Dallas BBQ scene, offering a truly authentic Texas smokehouse experience. The moment you step inside, you’re transported back to a time when barbecue was about more than just food—it was a way of life. The rich, smoky aroma hits you immediately, reminiscent of true Texas barbecue, where the flavors of mesquite and oak wood mingle perfectly with the tender meats.\n\nThe brisket at Pecan Lodge is a showstopper, cooked to perfection with a beautiful smoke ring and just the right amount of seasoning. It’s clear that every piece of meat is treated with care and a deep understanding of the barbecue craft. The ribs are equally impressive, falling off the bone with each bite, and the house-made sausage is a must-try, packed with flavor and a satisfying snap.\n\nOne of the standout features of Pecan Lodge is the dedication to tradition and quality. Everything is made from scratch, from the savory Southern Fried Chicken to the creamy mac n’ cheese and the delicious collard greens. Each side dish is crafted with as much care as the meats, adding to the overall experience. The sides are not just an afterthought but an essential part of the meal, enhancing the main courses with their bold and comforting flavors.\n\nBe prepared to wait, though, as lines can be long. But trust me, it’s worth every minute. The long wait is a testament to the popularity and quality of this establishment. Pecan Lodge has become a beloved spot for locals and visitors alike, with many people returning again and again for a taste of their superb barbecue.\n\nIn a city filled with great BBQ joints, Pecan Lodge stands out not only for its incredible food but also for its deep-rooted history and dedication to family and tradition. The owners, who left their corporate jobs to pursue a dream, have created a place that feels both familiar and extraordinary. This isn’t just about brisket or ribs; it’s about capturing the essence of Texas barbecue in every bite. Whether you’re a BBQ aficionado or just looking for a fantastic meal, Pecan Lodge should be at the top of your list. Don’t forget to save room for Aunt Polly’s banana pudding—you won’t regret it!']"

Asador,4.4,366,"[""Excellent restaurant in the Renaissance Dallas Hotel near the Market Center. In my experience, hotel restaurants aren't good, but Asador was one of the rare exceptions. Delicious food, well-prepared, and served by a friendly but unobtrusive staff. The diningroom had a quiet elegance--nice for older folks--and we were allowed to take our time. We started with the guacamole, which was tasty, then had the Brisket Burger, Smoked Turkey BLT, and the Smoked Chicken Tinga Tacos.

Wings and tacos are perfect for a light meal, and be sure to ask for rum punch, which Rosie at the bar got me started on. Breakfast is amazing and leaves you plenty full.

Salmon entree also flavorful if somewhat crispy.\n\nToo full for dessert but a good experience overall.

The table is wedged in the bottleneck and passed by all waitstaff picking up food from the kitchen often times sideways because of the bar crowd encroaching onto the space between the table and the bar.\nNevertheless, we had a great time that Julio so expertly made possible.

We did not feel rushed at all and was able to sit and enjoy the meal completely. Perry's is known for its pork chops but I felt like they were a little bit better in my memory which is a me problem.

The wine selection is quite varied and the champagne was delicious! Every course was spot on for presentation, taste and quantity. We were not disappointed with any aspect of our evening. They have a no tipping policy and only five tables so that you have an amazing experience. James, the waiter delivered exceptional customer service as well. Lastly, Gorji gave us an option of sauces to select as a parting gift. We tried it today and the Arrabiata Diavolo was spicy and delicious.

Please give this restaurant a try, you will not be disappointed."", ""We loved our intimate dinner at Gorji's.  The chef's beverage recommendations were spot-on.

We gave them all a chance. We really did like the chips and salsa which had a good kick. I am accustomed to getting complimentary chips and salsa, but the cost was minimal. My husband seemed to enjoy the chicken enchiladas and I very much liked the fish tacos. Our only dislike was the rice. It wasn’t bad, it was just different—tasted like it had cardamom mixed into it.

You had to pay for chips & salsa... at a Mexican restaurant, in Texas 😑 The prices were pretty high. None of our food was that great. I can understand if the food is amazing, but the tortillas tasted packaged from the grocery store (and not the fresh heb kind either). The rice was gross, the fajita chicken was not that great and our steak was overcooked (which we were then told we were wrong) the service was also kinda meh, had to ask multiple times for things.\n\nSide note (not their fault) sitting outside, you get hit with sewage smell and flies and bees were swarming our food. The water and tea also has a very funky taste (dallas water i guess?)\n\nAnyways, this was one of the most unimpressive Mexican restaurants we have ever been to and was quite a disappointing experience especially considering how much we paid. No one in our party of 5 enjoyed the experience or food."", 'Excellent service and mediocre food. First red flag was when our server let us know that chips and salsa were not complimentary. At a Mexican restaurant. In Texas…. The salsa was delicious though, and the chicken and steak enchiladas we ordered tasted good but were served room temperature and very dry. Drinks were okay. They were willing to make me a sangria swirl even though it wasn’t on the menu.

Well cooked, fresh and beautifully seasoned.  The flavors were on point.  More than enough food with each bowl.  5 out of 5.\n\nTruffle butter bread - This has to be the best bread I have ever eaten.  Crispy on the outside and soft in the middle.  The truffle butter was absolutely amazing.  Perfect amount for the four of us.  5 out of 5\n\nCalamari - From what my wife and daughter told me, it too was too of the line.  It was served with pickled cauliflower.  I do not eat seafood so I can not review it accurately.  I do know there was none left over so, I would say it was good also.\n\nItalian Donuts - We did get dessert for my bday and it was good as well.  I never thought I would say this but, I think it had to much sugar on top of the donuts.  It was still really good.  We shared between four people and it was plenty.  4 out of 5\n\nService: Our waiter was “Jaddi” and he was top of the line as well.  He knew the menu back and forward and was very kind and attentive.  The hostess was very kind as well.  She made some recommendations to which we tried and I am glad we did.  5 out of 5\n\nAtmosphere: The atmosphere was very elegant.  Plenty seating.  They did not have any booths available which was no problem because they have stool seats and outside seating as well.  Very clean from what I could tell.  The one thing I thought was a nice touch was the glass that separates the dining room and the kitchen.  This allows you to see what’s being done in the kitchen at all times.  5 out of 5\n\nPricing - the pricing was not cheap.  Each entree was about $20 each.  I would absolutely come back here because you often get what you pay for and we received quality food and service that was unlike any place I have been in a while.\n\nOverall, this place was really a gift to us on Father’s Day.  A friend recommended the place while we were walking around the mall about to go to another restaurant.  I am so glad we chose this one instead.  If you want to go on a date with your wife or entire family, I would recommend checking this place out for sure.']"

If you’re in Dallas and looking for something special, Petra and the Beast is a must-visit!', 'If you aren’t familiar with this restaurant, its location and outer appearance may trick you into not realizing how fantastic it is. The chef and owner, Misti Norris, has received several awards and recognition that seems to be so well-deserved. This restaurant emphasizes the importance of using the whole animal in their menu and finding ways to make parts of the animal that we don’t normally enjoy feel truly enjoyable.\n\nThe service is phenomenal. Helpful, attentive, and truly just seemed so happy to be there. I really appreciated being walked through the menu, which changes frequently based on what is in season and what they have access to. I really appreciated that it’s a very collaborative restaurant both in itself and in the community.\n\nThe food is indescribable. Partially because I’m not a food critique and can’t do it justice, but mostly because it was just the delicious.

We’ll absolutely be back and be recommending it to anyone looking for a great dinner spot.', 'The menu is flexible and they change it periodically. We randomly ordered some items, all of which were fusion creations. The pigtail seems to be a popular item. My kid loved it because it’s sweet and savory, though it was a bit too salty for my taste. The smoked red fish pasta was really delicious—flavorful without being too salty. It has a variety of textures and overall makes a nice meal without being overpriced. We will be back to try more items.', ""Unique dining experience.\nCame for brunch with a group of 6 on Sunday.\nServer (Jordan) was super cool. We all enjoyed her.\nWe ordered all the mains and sides. Food comes out as it's ready which is nice because it's fresh, but also reduces chances of pairing the dishes.\n\nThe bread pudding was the best! Almost like a chocolate brownie. Chef's kiss.\n\nAnecdote unrelated to my rating:\nI'm just not the biggest fan of this type of elevated cuisine, some people are. Just cause I'm not a fan doesn't mean this didn't live up to expectations in any way. This is more for people who may not be familiar so they know what they'll be getting into.\nSeveral times our group (consisting of people who are very into this) couldn't identify what dish was in the table unless Jordan did her great job telling us what it was. Look, the food tasted good and you can tell the craftsmanship and skill in preparation was 100% there. Just on some level if I'm going to brunch, I'd like to see a Benedict or hash, or biscuits and gravy. All of those can be elevated and executed delightfully. This was still a cool experience to go through.""]"
Al Biernat's Oak Lawn,4.7,2350,"['I had a delightful early dinner with my niece at this restaurant. The service was exceptional! I ordered the 10oz steak, which came with potatoes and green beans, costing a little over $60. My niece opted for the salmon salad. We also shared calamari and lobster risotto as side dishes. The steak was superb. Initially, I thought it was overcooked due to its exterior color, even though I ordered it medium. However, the exterior was just their seasoning with a slight crisp, and it was perfectly medium and delicious. The lobster risotto portion was generous, enough for two, and equally delightful. My niece thoroughly enjoyed her salmon and the calamari. Though it was pricey, it was a special occasion. Conveniently, valet parking is available for free at the back of the restaurant.', 'Al Biernat is one of the best steakhouses in Dallas and you will surely meet an important figure when going there. Highly recommend the breaded prawns and crab cakes to start with and make sure to end with the coconut cake.

Expect excellent service and ambience as well.', 'Came here awhile back for date night.\n\nThe food was flawlessly executed, we enjoyed our steak and there was a lot of leftovers to take home.\n\nI liked that they served calves liver as well, which you don’t often find in high end steakhouses.\n\nOur server recommended the seafood gumbo to us which was clutch!\n\nOne star less because we had to sit in the back area which wasn’t as nice and took away from the steakhouse experience', 'A very busy restaurant, but in fact, I think the food is just so-so.

Let me tell you, their breakfast game is strong - pancakes, omelettes, and even decaf coffee, which is a rarity these days. Tucked away among all these skyscrapers, this place is a hidden treasure. Just be warned, come on the wrong day and you'll be waiting in line out the door."", 'This small place was perfect for breakfast when no other places around were open. I got right in and the waitress took my order right away since I told here I had a conference to get to. The food came out in literally 7 minutes. That was service! The best part of what i ordered was the price. For eggs, sausage, hash brown, and pancakes it cost me only $10. It was typical diner food which means nothing spectacular, but it was a hearty and filling breakfast that was well worth the money. I love that the hash browns were cooked well with a nice brown crisp top. the only critique was that the butter was way too cold and hard so it was not spreadable on the pancakes. Also the pancakes were a bit dry, but the taste was spot on.', ""This is a legit NY style deli. My husband and I split the hot pastrami sandwich on rye with swiss cheese. I am a pastrami snob, and this pastrami did not disappoint. It was tender, flavorful, and piled high.

Kitchen + Kocktails by Kevin Kelley - Dallas,4.6,11049,"['Kitchen + Kocktails is an absolute gem! The moment you arrive, the restaurant’s striking presence on the corner, with large windows and eye-catching decals, draws you right in. As soon as I stepped inside, I was greeted with a warm smile from the beautiful hostess, and I was seated immediately at a cozy spot next to the bar. The bar itself is stunning—blue marble stone, giving off an elegant, classy vibe. I could easily imagine myself coming here just for drinks or to enjoy dinner, especially with the huge TVs hanging above the bar, perfect for watching a game or taking in the lively atmosphere.\n\nFor my meal, I ordered the blackened shrimp and grits with a fried lobster tail, and it was incredible! The food was seasoned to perfection—no extra seasoning needed at all. I also had the strawberry lemonade, which came with a purple sugar rim and was garnished beautifully with a strawberry, lemon, and fresh mint. It was delicious and refreshing.\n\nAlongside the shrimp and lobster, I tried a few sides: yams, greens, and mac & cheese—all cooked perfectly. Next time, I might add a little hot sauce to the greens, but that’s just personal preference.\n\nThe highlights for me were definitely the food, the ambiance, and the top-notch service. The restaurant has two levels—the upper level with black velvet seats and the lower with wooden tables—and the entire staff was super friendly. Another standout during my visit to Kitchen + Kocktails was Robert, the assistant general manager. He was incredibly attentive, and it was such a nice touch to have him introduce himself to me personally. It was also impressive to see him doing the same with other guests, checking in on everyone periodically, ensuring that we were all having a great experience. His presence and leadership made the restaurant feel clean, smoothly run, and welcoming.\n\nRobert, the assistant General Manager’s interactions with both the guests and the staff were warm and professional, creating an environment that you’d want to be a part of. It’s clear he takes pride in his work, and it wouldn’t surprise me to see him becoming a general manager at one of their locations soon. The entire team, from Robert’s leadership to the rest of the staff, is doing a fantastic job.\n\nThe service at Kitchen + Kocktails was just as impressive as the food and ambiance, thanks to my waitress, Taylor. She was super sweet, friendly, and personable, making the entire experience even better. Taylor made sure I had everything I needed, was attentive without being overbearing, and truly added to the warm, welcoming atmosphere. Her genuine friendliness made me feel right at home, and it was clear she takes pride in making sure her guests have a great time. Overall, Taylor’s service was a standout and another reason I can’t wait to come back!\n\nOverall, this place is fantastic, and I can’t wait to return. With four other locations, I’ll definitely make it a point to visit if I’m ever in one of those cities. Highly recommended!', 'The food and service was Amazing. Adrian was so patient and knowledgeable about everything. He really made the experience worth coming back our next visit to Dallas. Don’t let the dress code persuade you not to come because it is not enforced. Very nice and trendy place, the music was great, the food and drinks were even better. Very fast service, food was hot and flavorful. Again, thank you Adrian for making this such a wonderful experience!!!', 'My husband and I had a great time..it was our first time here coming from Houston. Everything was on point, food amazing, drinks strong and creative. The music was a great vibe and at the best noise level where you can talk and hear the music. Our waitress was really good, nice, attentive at the right times. I love everything about the aesthetics of the restaurant. Really hope the owner is trying to add one in Houston it would be a vibe!! Definitely will come back when we visit again, and will tell family and friends about it.', 'This place is a gem! I’ve lived Dallas all my\nLife and this is the best restaurant I’ve been to!

Terilli's Restaurant,4.6,1584,"['Just had a horrible dining and service experience here. Went to celebrate a friend’s birthday and definitely felt like I will never return. The one highlight was the crab claws; they were very tasty and cooked so very well.  Even though they had to prepare them twice (they prepared them with cheese) they were prompt and apologized for the mistake).\n\nAfter we ate our appetizer, the waitress took our order. From the time we ordered till the food arrived, it took  41 minutes. The neighboring table (a lovely couple from San Antonio) came in shortly after we had appetizers and had their meals before ours. Even the waitress was confused. I asked to speak to “Jerry” the manager, he came over and told me, seafood takes longer to prepare. The orders were lobster and shrimp.\n\nHe was literally trying to pick a fight with me. I didn’t comment on his seafood takes longer, but I noted to him his lack of concern. He responded well I can stop the food from coming out if that’s what you want. I was celebrating a friend’s birthday and didn’t want to cause a scene but as you can imagine I was really upset. All he had to do was take accountability.\n\nThe food arrived and my order was still incorrect (I ask for light sauce due to dairy sensitivity). I let them know and it came back almost the exact same. I scraped the sauce and it was less than flavorful - nothing like the crab claws from earlier.\n\nWe also asked for silverware, they never arrived. The couple next to us literally got up and brought us silverware from an empty table. It was just a terrible display of service and quality.\n\nI added the video of the overcooked lobster. It was so incredibly tough.\n\nThis Jerry guy is definitely not a reflection of the old Terilli’s that welcomed everyone and you left with good food and a great experience. I can easily say, I will never return.', ""garlic knots amazing!!! OH EM GEE!!!\nPractice self control if you can!!!\nThe italchos were good but I think next time I'll do build your own\nI had the Smoked Chicken Ravioli but got it with their truffle cream sauce instead and it was delicious.\nUpgraded my side to Lobster bisque for a charge.   Very lacking in Lobster flavor. i'm not sure i even got one chunk of lobster- so it's like if theres NO CHUNKS OF LOBSTER then at least make it taste like lobster please.\nMy dinner mates enjoyed their Creamy Tuscan Chicken. This particular night was not what I would call actual jazz.  It was more so 70s and 80s hits sung with just a piano. Not complaining just not what i wanted to hear that night. Great service as well. I\nwould def return to this place to try something else."", ""The evening was memorable!! I loved it! It was my sister's 54th birthday party dinner and it was GREAT!! Service was stellar and the food was better than the service! We will definitely be back!!"", 'We celebrated my little brother’s birthday here, it was great! We enjoyed the food and the ambiance.

Dakota's Steakhouse,4.5,1792,"['We enjoyed a lovely meal at Dakota’s. The directions finding the place was a bit tricky off the highway but nonetheless, it was worth it!\n\nUpon entry descending down to the restaurant, We admired the waterfall and ambiance upon entering the restaurant. The music was low to encourage dinner conversation and we were pleased.\n\nWe tried the tots that were handmade and the best tots we have ever had, the salmon tart and were both tasty! We had the steak (cowboy) and beef wellington, both were divine but I think my steak was the winner with all the flavour to savour!\n\nThe only reason we gave a 4 out of 5 star rating was the spacing. We were fairly close to our neighbouring diners. My chair was against a beam or pole where a plastic tarp covered the patio because of the summer temperature. I had trouble each time I had to excuse to go to the restroom because the chair was next to the beam and to the diners next to our table.\n\nOverall, the experience was pleasant and compliments to our server Adrian who provided service with a smile for the entire time.', 'Honestly such a great experience. I came for my birthday for a solo dinner and my experience was amazing!! Like so so good. I had the BEST server, she was the sweetest and made sure I enjoyed my time. I can’t wait to go back!', 'This is my third time to Dakota’s, the food here is the best absolutely delicious each time I have came. ( I have not gotten Steak) One of the best calamari’s in Dallas. The cocktails are okay I am not blown away and leave craving them. The service overall is good but if you come on weekends it gradually gets not bad but you’d expect better for the price. The Rocky road ice cream is so good! They have Valet right in front of the restaurant but all cheap street parking very close. My food was delicious!', 'Girls night out pre-concert last night, and my friend and I stumbled on this gem. It was a great find, and certainly fancier than we anticipated. The service was beyond amazing. However- we were wearing graphic concert tee’s (me with a blazer, her with a jacket), and were asked to cover up after she removed her jacket. So… the dress code is a real thing. We had lobster corn dog, the tater tot, black truffle risotto, a duck pasta dish, and the sweet potato fries. It was all- just WOW. Will go back when we are back in town. It was very dark, and very loud.', ""Amazing service, food, and atmosphere. I can see now why it was packed. Absolutely loved the mash potatoes they have. Pricey, but the best dining experience I've ever had.\n\nIf it's your anniversary, you get a free slice of cake at the end. 😉""]"

The most important thing is the service., the service was amazing!! And the jewelry of the crown was the food. The food was incredible, I highly recommend the pastas. Definitely we will go back soon.', ""We were visiting Dallas and found this gem.  Our experience was fantastic.  The food was amazing, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was great.  It is rare to find such exceptional food in a relaxed and unpretentious environment.  We loved it and can't wait to return!"", ""What a wonderful experience. David did a fantastic job of elaborating on the intricate details and preparation of each dish. His warm welcome and description of the menu set the mood for the remainder of the experience.\n\nEvery single employee is engaged and contributing to the world class experience that is Lucia. I simply can't think one one single thing that could have been done better. Even the bathrooms were impressive, private, and clean. This isn't dinner, this is a 2 hour pampered vacation. The craft cocktails are crisp and refreshing. The service and kitchen execution is surprisingly good."", 'The food is good but it’s not like AMAZING I will crave for it level, but the fact that the servers automatically get 20% tip, I felt like I was getting pushed to order more food from the server… and also being watched the whole time… I know they are trying to be attentive but I really don’t like that. The portion is small but we are 5 girls and we were basically full after the food. And the third dessert on the menu was THE BEST ITEM out of all we have ordered and I will have a craving for that dessert\n.', ""Lucia offers an inventive menu that is different from most other options out there. The change of pace is nice and I'm always excited to try the new choices but I feel like execution could be slightly better. Bread was over cooked and pacing could be better despite ordering all at once. I don't regret ever going to Lucia but I'm not immediately rushing back.""]"

Excellent customer service!', 'Excellent Sunday Brunch, exquisite vibes, selections and service.\nSimple and convenient online reservation option, after valeting we were promptly seated upon arrival to the restaurant (located on the 3rd floor rooftop). The first two floors offer interior and exterior showroom inspirations and shopping opportunities.\n\nOur server was very personable, she explained the menu well and made perfect pairing selections. We sampled a few libations and bites while we chatted and enjoyed the scenery. There are indoor and outdoor restaurant seating options offered, the fountain in the center was mesmerizing.\n\nThe entire venue is top tier in quality, vibes and offerings.

Lobster roll is the best in my opinion.\nI noticed the servers wouldn’t clear the plates when a new dish hit the table, it was kinda cramped when they would bring new dishes and wouldn’t help out on clearing the table either. Service was pretty slow not sure why they didn’t come to the table as much as I thought they would.', ""Most beautiful experience.\n\nYou will need a reservation.\n\nThis restaurant is on the third floor of Restoration Hardware,  a luxury furniture store.

The food was delicious and incredibly perfectly portioned. This place truly is a nice place to have a small meal and enjoy the scenery and have an intimate small date. Or just to enjoy brunch. The only reason I have chosen to give 4 out of 5 stars was even though I enjoyed everything around the restaurant such as food and atmosphere. I specifically chose the restaurant for my anniversary dinner, as such I reserved our tables and even made small requests. Neither the anniversary was mentioned or noted in my reservation. and even when asked and responding to the question if it’s for a specific occasion. I would have thought maybe something like a dessert would have been on the house. But I noticed if it’s your birthday they give you free cake or ice cream. Spending such a large amount of money on dinner and having done so at many nice establishments around Dallas. I just expected something like that if I chose to have my anniversary somewhere nice. Even thought it’s not required for the restaurant. I’ve experienced it at others and thought it would have been a nice treat for the wife. Truly not a deal breaker but maybe next time it’ll be a more causal visit instead of a special one.']"

I went for my partner's birthday.\nThe atmosphere was great, but I didn't like the fact that our table was right next to the hostess stand literally 4 ft from the door. (Still not a reason for the rating) The celebration music and sign with the cupcake wheel is fun. Similar to another Dallas restaurant where the workers dance.\nThe food was okay. The lobster tacos were excellent, but that was about it. My steak was undercooked, and I do not send food back. The mashed potatoes were dry. My partner did enjoy his burger and fries, and it was cute with the pink buns.\nThe server was good and attentive, but what I have an issue with is the fact that he took the liberty of adding 20% tip when he brought the initial bill out. When did restaurants start adding the tip upfront on the initial bill for a party of 2??? I've been to many (and I do mean many) fine establishments, and this practice has never happened. I didn't make an issue of it because I was going to give at least 20% because again he did a good job, but the fact that he added this upfront put a bad taste in mouth. I did not add any additional tip, and there was a spot to do so. (Out of control)\nMy partner enjoyed himself, and that's what matters. It would have to be another special occasion for him for me to even think about coming back.\nAgain, it's a great concept, but if you also focus on the quality of all your food, this place would be amazing.  I don't know why your staff has to stoop to those types of tactics. If it's trained, encouraged, or a one-off, it needs to stop."", ""You want pink and wonderful food? This IS the place. Pink, girly, fun, boisterous in the best way, great photo-ops. We made reservations for a Saturday night and had a blast. The food was amazing, the drinks were amazing.

Outside of the seasoning I will say that the food was prepared well and the service is great. Cupcake Ferris wheel and staff singing Happy Birthday is worth the extra $100 bucks so don't hold back.

She could tell that my son was on the spectrum so she wrote me a note asking to conform it. When I told her yes, she then asked if he had any triggers she could watch for. As a mom to a special needs child, that meant the world to me. So often he isn\'t ""seen"" and people just think he\'s weird or a badly behaved kid.

First of all, I had high expectations because a friend told me this was a great “farm to table” type of restaurant. First of all, it was not that. Food was incredibly underwhelming and we ordered almost half the menu for our group of 4. They also forgot to bring our peas, which we were charged for, and my husband now thinks is too late to contest.\n\nThe initial presentation of the food was always more impressive than the food itself. Everything was either too salty or saucy. Nothing tasted “farm to table” like the way it’s done in California. Drinks were decent and probably the only things worth getting.\n\nAlso, for a restaurant that charges and acts like a wannabe Michelin star restaurant, they really need to have bag stands. My friend and I had very expensive bags and the waiter had no interest in helping us put it somewhere, stating there was a reservation next to us. The reservation did not show up until 1.5 hours later, I checked.\n\nRidiculous. Won’t come back.

Hillstone,4.3,1746,"['Hillstone consistently delivers excellent food and the servers are skilled at what they do. The French dip is one of the best in town. Pro tip: I ask for a spoon so I can pour the jus over the sandwich as opposed to dip it in the cup and watch half of the meat fall out. The house salad is a great and they prepare real croutons for it. It gets a bit dark for my taste when they dim the lights during dinner. The only thing I don’t like about Hillstone is the dread I feel in anticipation of my interaction with the hostess. I’ve been here many times and engaged with several different hostesses. Without exception, they convey a sense of pretentiousness.

I highly recommend trying Hillstone or any of the other restaurants from its parent company.', ""Today at Hillstone in Dallas, my three-year-old son and I experienced a transformative moment when two women and staff members openly discriminated against us. My son was being a normal, nap-deprived child, and I boldly advocated for him when the women behind me demanded I 'control' him and for him to “be quiet”. I fearlessly pushed back, and they tried to belittle me, but the staff sought to calm things without acknowledging my concerns and instead siding with the two women who initiated conflict. The manager told me verbatim, “we can not have loud children in the restaurant.” I asked him  was there a policy in place that prohibited children and he told me “no there is not but we can not allow loud children.” My son and I left, feeling uplifted to stand up for my son's needs."", 'Just as Houston’s is to Atlanta, Hillstone is the place for a wonderful upscale meal in the Dallas area.

And the presentation is simple, yet artful. I was recently in NYC and went for sushi. The buzz in the restaurant was amazing, but the food itself doesn’t hold a candle to Uchi.

The fish quality was disappointingly mid-tier, lacking the freshness and flavor one would expect at a restaurant of this caliber.\n\nHot dishes such as spicy garlic scallop and miso black cod were overly salty, overshadowing any subtle flavors they might have had. Of all the ways they could’ve been creative, they decided to ruin king crab by deep frying then drowning in ponzu sauce. Another area that needs improvement is the dessert menu, which lacked creativity and failed to excite the palate. The service, however, was excellent. Staffs were attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly.', ""When you pay more for something than usual and you have an amazing experience, it makes it all worth it. The Lamb Chops, the Snow crab Leg, the Chicken and Beef skewers, were just super delicious and want me going back to Nobu.

Also, the Lamb Chops, I had mine medium, I took a bite and that was it..I thought I died and went to heaven, no kidding, my family members ordered well done and theirs were equally good, very delicious, melt in your mouth Lamb chops, I can write a book praising them, so good.

Additionally, ensuring that vegetarian options like the veggie burger are well-prepared and flavorful would cater to a wider range of palates.\n\nOverall, I see great potential in your menu, and with some adjustments to better reflect the vibrant and flavorful aspects of Creole cuisine, I believe you could truly stand out in the culinary scene."", ""Nice cozy shaded seat outside patio with a great sounding band was my favorite part.\n\nI got the andoullie sausage .

Smokey with some kick on the backend.\n\nFeeling gluttonous (we had lots of leftovers), we also ordered the panda cotta for dessert. It was unusual, but light. A nice way to end a heavy meal.

Originally I thought it was ink sauce but it turned out it was tomato based with ink pasta. The ingredients were plenty and the seasoning was good, but the pasta itself I feel less flavory. For the desserts, the server directly showed us the options physically in front of us, which was quite neat. I ended up ordering the classic tiramisu. The taste was good, not too sweet.

Orchestria Palm Court Restaurant,4.7,194,"['This is a unique restaurant with a good-old-day atmosphere of a brick warehouse setting.

They have a unique menu and they seem to be very conscious of having quality healthy ingredients.  They told me that this is one of the very few locations in the United States where you could still get phosphate drinks.\n\nThe entire seating area is surrounded by a variety of animatronic automated pianos that use a form of sheet rolls to play a variety of tunes.  It was very fascinating to enjoy our meal and watch and listen to these machines play around us.\n\nI believe the two partners that founded this place work behind the two different bar areas, they have quite the story of how they founded the restaurant based on their personal passion for collecting these machines.  And then the collection only grew and the result is this fascinating restaurant.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun and unique experience in a vintage setting, then this place is for you."", ""This restaurant has a lot of interesting character in its decor with player pianos and other musical devices that still work and play period music.

The pricing was very reasonable, even with a 25% tip automatically added to the bill. The service was friendly but not necessarily attentive. This is probably by design. The customer's orders are not taken at the table. They have to go to the bar (in the back) to place the order and pay the check.

It’s like getting dinner and a show. The favorite part of the evening was definitely the drinks! The soda fountain options are creative and tasty. The apricot ambrosia is particularly good, with nice almond flavor that balances the tartness of the apricot. The best drink of the evening was the East Frisia tea service. A hot pot of Assam black tea atop a tea candle to keep it warm arrived on a silver tray with rock sugar. You place cube in the cup and then as the tea is poured over, the cube crackles like an ice cube. Assam tea is reminiscent of English breakfast.', 'If it ain’t broken, don’t fix it, right?\nI am more like a modern person type. But I would say 5 stars because I know about history from 1900s. The phones and automated music boxes work like they really are. Services it fine. 4 because I don’t really feel very welcomed.

Plenty of space and you will need that elbow room when you start eating. Table ordering was as quick as a code scan and the food came out piping hot with a presidential presentation. The menu is vast, choosing what you want may be the hardest thing. The ribs were smoked and falling off the bone and better without any sauce. The catfish was fried perfectly. The fried chicken was like that brown paper bag chicken momma made back in the day…crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside! We enjoyed yams, collards, peas, mac and cheese, sweet cornbread muffins and to wrap it up cobbler, keylime pie and banana pudding! Every serving size was built for 2 which meant we needed plates to go. I really like the fact that they have a “to-go” station. Grab your containers and pack it up yourself.

Someone was filling the drink orders that I assume were through the QR code. You can order drinks through the code but not something like a bourbon and soda water (at least I didn’t see the option). She wouldn’t let us order our drinks and said the bartender was on her break. Didn’t make sense that someone else wasn’t covering the bar while the main bartender was on her break.\n\nOverall lame bar service but the food hit the spot. Probably my favorite were the lemon pepper wings. All the sides were good too (tried black eyed peas, Mac and cheese, yams, cole slaw). Pulled pork had good flavor but dry (BBQ sauce it up). Brisket was nice and smokey with a nice seasoned crust. Fat was rendered nicely.\n\nI don’t care for ordering through my phone but you can go order at the front.\n\nI’ve had better BBQ but I think this is one of the best in the area in San Jose. I definitely would return', 'My husband & I came for a Saturday lunch date. I’m vegetarian, he is not, so we’re always concerned about options.

I enjoyed every bite.\n\nEntry is tight and parking is plenty in the back.\n\nWill definitely return to try more of their menu.', 'Delicious Mexican-American food! Salsa is just right spicy. Pico de gallo, avocado, and habanero. Huge portions. We split the Mexican steak and eggs and had leftovers. Will definitely return.']"
Adega,4.4,559,"['A great Portuguese restaurant in the Little Portugal area of San Jose, serving tapas style small dishes meant to be shared with friends and family. The location used to be the Adega restaurant and has very tasteful decor. The staff were all vert friendly and helpful. We sampled many small dishes and all were very unique and delicious. The seafood rice, shrimp in garlic sauce, sautéed vegetables, and the banana bread pudding dessert were some of the standout dishes. Even the house wheat bread was unexpectedly good and we used it to soak up the garlic sauce from the shrimp dish. However, serving sizes of most of the dishes were smaller than expected, especially the seafood rice that came with a $39 price tag. Other than that, everything else was perfect. Overall a good place to try Portuguese food, which is quite unique, and distinct from Spanish tapas.', ""Overall, the food was great and we had really good service! The plates are shareable, so make sure that you order 1-2 more to ensure that there's enough food if you're going as a group. Parking is difficult to find, but not impossible. You will need to drive around the neighborhood behind the restaurant to get street parking."", 'My family and I had a delicious lunch here!\n\nWe’re not familiar with Portuguese food so we ordered what looked good.\n\nWe started with the cheese bread, flamed chouriço, and blood sausage.  The cheese bread was so cheese and had a nice bounce in texture.  The choiriço was literally served in flames and had a really nice smoky texture.  The blood sausage was absolutely delicious!  It was savory with a crisp edges.  That was a highlight from that round.\n\nThe next round of plates included sautéed veggies, shrimp bread porridge, and duck rice.   The duck rice was labeled as a popular choice and I can see why.  It is rich with duck fat and the rice crisped up really well in its cast iron skillet.  I definitely recommend it.  And don’t sleep on the veggies!  They were also charred nicely and the balsamic reduction gave it a nice sweetness, balanced with acidity.  The shrimp bread porridge was full of shrimp and chucks of soft bread that soaked up the slightly garlicky sauce really well.\n\nOther dishes include the mussels and the cod casserole.  I don’t like mussels so I can’t comment on that.  The cod was interesting.  I’ve never had a fish like that before and the only reason I wanted to try it was because Trader Joe’s has a version of it.  I found it to be salty for my taste, but perhaps that’s how it should be.  My dad commented that the cod and the shrimp would’ve worked well with a glass of wine.  But he was driving and I didn’t want alcohol, so that’s something we missed out on.\n\nWe didn’t get dessert because we went to their pastry store in downtown San Jose to get tarts and malasadas.   But the tarts are available here.\n\nService was fantastic!  They explained the menu and the food came out at a good pace.  And it’s really well decorated inside!  Lunch is casual so you don’t need to dress up, but do look presentable.  The decor has more of a fine dining vibe, and I guess that may be because it turns into Adego, a Michelin rated restaurant, in the evening.\n\nParking is tricky.  There is a narrow alley that you can easily miss where there’s a few spots in the back.  I read reviews that there’s a lot across the street but I didn’t see anything.  Make time to find parking.\n\nI would really like to come back here to try more dishes.', 'My wife and I came here for a date night before going to a comedy show.\n\nThe ambiance was formal, but no requirement for black tie or suit, per standard California dress attire. Jeans, with a polo was fine, there were other patrons there with T-shirts.\n\nThe wait staff was inviting and helpful.\n\nWe ordered the cheese bread (pão de queijo), shrimp fritters, potato salad (salada russa), seafood rice, pork and clams, and for dessert an orange tart.\n\nFor starters we got the cheese bread was fantastic, light, airy, and slightly chewy. It was not overly cheesy, perfect amount of salt.\n\nThe shrimp fritters were tasty, although my wife thought the fritters were too ""shrimpy/seafoody"" in flavor. Crispy on the outside with chopped shrimp on the inside.\n\nThe potato salad was a bit underwhelming, however, I thought green beans were an interesting element to the dish. The flavor was bland with mayo being the primary flavor to the dish. I prefer a little more tang and mustard to my potato salad, however it was an interesting rendition.\n\nThe pork and clams were in a rich gravy and tasted fantastic, the only issue was it was literally pork and clams, there was no starch to accompany the dish so it felt a little rich by itself. Great flavor, clams were fresh and the pork was tender.\n\nThe seafood rice was mostly good. The mussels were cooked well, not over cooked and not undercooked, and the lobster, and clams in the rich sauce worked well with the rice. One clam I ate went bad so I unfortunately I had to spit it out, but it didn\'t affect the rest of the dish.\n\nLastly, for dessert, we finished with an orange tart. The dish was a nice touch to finish the meal, not too sweet, slightly bitter, orangy, and bready. The bread was soaked through with a sweet syrup, the bitterness came from notes of the orange peel.\n\nAll in all a decent meal for a fair price. I included a photo of the menu and pictures of everything we ate for reference for size of each dish.', 'This is a long overdue post, so much so that they rebranded from Adega to Petiscos early this year.\nServes me right for waiting so long and not asking the waiters for updates 😅\n\nAdega served everything from what you would expect from a Michelin starred restaurant. And the seafood and desserts were flavorful and delicious, I believe the chef team is the same.\n\nAs for Petiscos, the scallops and octopus were grilled to perfection and the desserts were delicious, especially the pastel de nata.\n\nWe’ve also been to the downtown location, which also has a casual vibe, compared to their previous restaurant Adega, serving more tapas, but nevertheless delicious.']"

It was food that you would be familiar with like a tamale or a  fajita but made with authentic ingredients and according to oaxacan tradition and technique.

I would look into them instead. You'll definitely thank me 😉"", ""Beautiful patio seating area, don't forget to make a reservation!\n\nI usually dislike dining outdoors, but Mezcal's patio area is covered to protect you from the elements, with peeks of the open sky and fresh air flow.\n\nCame here for a team dinner and we tried a bunch of stuff, but I'd definitely recommend the octopus and the guacamole!

Elyse Restaurant,4.4,285,"['It was a pleasure to return to Elyse after their recent reopening in Downtown San Jose. The new location is fantastic, and the dining experience was just as delightful as I remembered.\nThe appetizers were a highlight. The brussel sprouts with Dijon dressing and mussels are a must-try, both dishes being flavorful and well-prepared. The ahi tuna salad was decent, providing a fresh and light start to the meal.\nFor the main entrées, I thoroughly enjoyed the lamb ribs, which were served with creamy mashed potatoes and slices of carrots. The glazed sea bass was also cooked to perfection. For steak lovers, the Basses-côtes is a must-try.\nDesserts were outstanding, with the mint panna cotta and lava cake providing a perfect end to the meal. I look forward to returning to Elyse to try out their specials and enjoy another wonderful dining experience. 😃😌', ""TLDR: A nice restaurant with good food, but really needs to a) lean into the Vietnamese more, and b) provide more vegan options.\n\nAtmosphere: Elyse is a very nice restaurant that is quite unassuming from the exterior. I greatly enjoyed the simple, but fine details.\n\nService: Generally good, kind, but seemed a bit bored because we were the only table being served.\n\nFood: Due to an unusually long wait time (even though we were literally the only table at the restaurant at 6:00 on a Wednesday), they graciously brought out a free jackfruit salad. This was quite tasty and was a refreshingly good start to the meal. Our table also ordered the crispy brussels which were also very good. I as the vegan was really excited for some vegan Vietnamese food and the menu online noted I multiple options that are no longer available unfortunately. My only entree option was a cassoulet which was good, but nothing mind blowing. Without any form of plant-based protein, it was more a bean stew that really needed a kick of pepper or something to bring it out of averageness. Compared to the apps, it was very boring. The two omni's enjoyed their food as more so. If I was rating this solely on a vegan's perspective, I would probably say the food is around 3-3.5 stars, but with the omni's enjoying their food, I bumped it up to a solid 4: Good, but not great.\n\nOverall, I would definitely try Elyse again next time I am in San Jose, but only if there are some actual Vietnamese options on the menu. While I understand that France colonized Vietnam and the cuisine's are intermixed, this feels more like a French restaurant with a tiny dash of Vietnam."", 'Not too many dishes on the menu though, I really like the lamb and the short ribs, appetizers are also meet my expectations.\nHowever, the environment downgraded the total score here. Food, service and the location are really good. If they can change all the cookwares, furniture and lighting here, the experience can be much more better.', 'Wanted to love it but couldn\'t.\n\nElyse wants to be a nice fancy restaurant but lacks the details of service and food quality to even be considered in that category.\n\nWould I come back, most likely not due to mediocre food and overpriced menu.\n\nWhat we ate: Coq Au Vin, Sea bass,  Mussels, and Fries (they can\'t even make the advertised ""double fried"" fries crispy.', ""The mushroom appetizer was so delicious! My mouth is salivating just thinking about it. The drinks were also very well made and creative. I ordered the short ribs which were cooked perfectly. I thought it was a little bit bland but it might be my own ignorance to what French cuisine is supposed to taste like. My boyfriend got the ribeye with mushroom sauce and, again, the sauce was amazing. So flavorful and delicious!!!\n\nThe tiramisu was a bit of a disappointment.

Cheese bread was interesting but thought it was a bit dry. Would have liked a dip with it. Shrimp fritters were cheesy fried shrimp.\n\nOrdered the asparagus rice, cod a bras. It lacked flavour but texture was good. Needed more seasoning.', 'Went there on a Saturday night with reservation. It was completely packed and we had to wait to be seated. We were seated after a short wait.\nThe server was very hospitable and friendly. He informed us that we could combine both the ala carte and the set menu instead of both of us having to stick with a particular menu.\nSo we did a combination of 1 set menu and a few ala carte dishes. The bread that was served with olives, olive oil and butter on the side was very dense, almost having a density of a dense pound cake. Then we had the grilled shrimps which had unfortunately a mushy texture. Otherwise it is rather tasty. The flamed chouriço tasted nothing out of the ordinary but definitely had a visual appeal when brought to the table with the flame still burning.\nNext came the octopus which was also tasty but on the verge of tasting a slight mush as well. Then we were served the duck rice which had a piece of rather fat looking pork belly that I did not try to taste since it looked rather bland, although I usually do love pork belly. The rice was tasty but greasy and the duck meat tasted bland. Since I was still hungry with all the servings being kind of small, I decided to order the garlic shrimps which was raved about by other reviewers. I did enquire with the server before placing the order as I wanted to make sure it wasn’t going to taste mushy and it didn’t. He did ensure me that it shouldn’t and if it did, he would take it off the check/bill.\nSince the pastel de nata sounded really popular on the reviews, and I recalled that someone complained about it running out, I told the hostess to save 1 for me. I was glad I did not ask for more as it unfortunately did not taste like the Portuguese egg custard tart pastry that I was used to having. The custard part of the pastry had a consistency similar to a thick jam than that of a custard and the taste was way too sweet for me to savor the taste of the egg custard. I had enough Portuguese egg tarts pastry in my life to safely say this was my least favorite here. As for the chocolate mousse I can’t seem to quite put a finger to the taste, but again, the mousse did not have a light enough texture and the chocolate mousse tasted like it was made with a cheap diluted milk chocolate.\nOverall, I think the kitchen did not meet the mark on almost all the dishes in terms of the taste profile. I definitely think the food was overrated. I would actually consider it overpriced due to the quality of the ingredients and the quantity of each dish.\nThe environment was very lively and bustling even without loud music…everyone was talking loudly in an enclosed space and the noise level was quite deafening. Towards the end of the night, you could see the tables that were vacated in the dinning area were left with dirty dishes which was quite a sight I had not seen in a restaurant before, especially since I could clearly see several staff congregating by the bar and chatting. I can see 2 out of the 4 were probably bartenders but can’t understand why the other 2 would stand around the adjacent bar area instead of trying to clear up the mess; almost like they were deliberately trying to avoid cleaning up the tables. I see only 3 other servers running around serving the customers in the entire big dinning room.\nThis is a Michelin Bib Gourmand restaurant, but it definitely doesn’t live up to the standards. The only plus of this restaurant was both the server and the hostess who attended to us were very friendly and hospitable. Unfortunately I have to conclude that the food and restaurant are overrated based on this experience and I can’t recommend.', 'Food portion is smaller than I thought, but I think they taste good until I had the seafood rice. The main reason why I gave 2-star is that the mussels in seafood rice have a horrible smell and do not taste fresh. When I talked to our waiter, he apologized, but I think a better way would be offer us an exchange', 'I went as a solo diner and sat at the bar. The food was delicious and most of the dishes had just a few ingredients that let each ingredient shine. The one exception was the steak, for me it was over-prepared with the Demi glaze and fried egg on top; seemed a shame to hide a beautiful cut of meat under all of that. My one complaint would be that the meal was really expensive and I don’t know if it was quite worth the price.']"

From the outside it looks unappealing, next door to a liquor store, but from the inside you're taken to a quaint homey atmosphere! Note that it's a fixed menu where you select 3 or 4 courses (4 is plenty, dishes are very rich) at a very affordable price compared to the other gourmet restaurants in the area! Highly recommend getting soup as one of the dishes, and I'd skip the lettuce salad - everything else was amazing! For the main courses we got the sea bass and steak - both were exquisitely made!

We also ordered a cappuccino to complete the meal. The service was wonderful and the ambience, very elegant. We enjoyed the pastas more than the pizza, maybe because it was the vegan variant.

Staff were very busy, and the first dish took a while to arrive, but afterwards the dishes came at a brisk pace.  Look forward to returning."", 'Went there on a Saturday for dinner. Ordered 4 tapas…my usual choice of grilled octopus and shrimps. The texture of the octopus felt like it was frozen and had suffered from freezer burnt if u know what I mean…It was also a tad salty. Kinda disappointing. The shrimps tasted ok, but shrimp heads were all removed which I’d much rather they had kept them intact. The potatoes in brava sauce were lukewarm and too thinly sliced. The catalan pork sausage looked very unappetizing, sitting in a broth. The menu didn’t mention the style of preparation but listed that it comes with a sauce and potatoes. There was no potatoes in sight and it is not a sauce but a broth. I didn’t eat it but my friend said it tasted like any sausage, which is sad. Not including a pic of the sausage since I didn’t bother taking a pic of the dish as I refuse to eat it. Overall, I’m unimpressed with the food and experience.', 'Very solid wine bar, great service and a flashy House Sangria pour.

I don’t think the shrimp was simmered in the sauce like the first time, it tasted more like they cooked shrimp in water then threw it in sauce…so the flavor was more watered down. Then I was disappointed because we had ordered extra corn to be added to shrimp, but they forgot and so they brought it separately.the “outside” corn tasted terrible . It’s just the cheap frozen highly processed kind and tasted worse without immersion in the sauce. I was disappointed in corn and the way my meal was cooked this time. 3.5 stars.

Really the best….\n\nThe garlic noodle was simple and also delish 4.5 stars\n\nWe also had lobster tail in garlic sauce with French bread and that was 4,5 stars!\n\nI smelled like garlic for two days.']"
Rollati Ristorante,4.1,208,"['Rollati has a fabulous atmosphere and decor. It feels classy, industrial, down-to-earth yet upscale.

The chef has played it too safe. I wouldn\'t be surprised if every dish was served at Olive Garden. It\'s not that they are not tasty nor edible. They\'re just not special. At least at Olive Garden, you get value.\n\nFried calamari - bland and mainstream. Crab cakes - bland and uneventful. Garlic bread only saved by the cheese. Fried risotto balls - what am I eating? It was just fried mush. Lobster or crab pasta was salvaged by the seafood but again, the pasta and the sauce was just mediocre.

Kindness you don't see at most restaurants. We were seated in a corner where my son was able to watch the back staff make pizzas and cook to perfection. The food arriving was good timing, we didn't have to wait much.\nThe food was delicious! When ordering the  thousand layer lasagna, you have to get the short rib ragu with it, the short rib is so tender great in flavor and just makes the plate amazing.

The Thousand Layer Lasagne, a masterpiece of culinary artistry, featured delicate pasta sheets interwoven with rich Bolognese sauce each bite a symphony of flavors and textures. The Spaghetti alla Limon, a refreshing twist on a classic, offered a perfect balance of tangy lemon zest, garlic-infused olive oil, and a sprinkle of Parmigiano-Reggiano, transporting our taste buds to the heart of Italy.\n\nTo end our dinner Rollati surprised us with complimentary cannoli to celebrate our double birthday occasion. The cannoli, with its crisp pastry shell filled with velvety ricotta cream and hints of citrus and vanilla, provided a sweet conclusion to our meal.\n\nService at Rollati was exemplary, with attentive staff ensuring every need was met promptly and courteously.

Yea, I’d definitely go back there. This was my favorite bar that night in San Jose.', 'Went to paper plane on a Tuesday evening and found a table instantly. It was pretty full already but I can image it would get more even more crowded during the weekends. They do not accept reservations (unless you have a party greater than 12).

Usually I’m wary of these random food specials but the wife and I decided to just give it a shot. Pretty solid prime rib with au jus and horseradish, mashed potatoes, and corn. You do have to buy a drink with the meal but that’s not an issue being that you’re at a craft bar, so there’s great options.

I chose this restaurant based on the good reviews on the food. Since we did come here to take advantage of the restaurant week promotion with restaurants offering prix fixe menus which consist of their more popular food selection at a more attractive price, naturally we tried both the options offered for the event at this restaurant. Everything is served full size. However, I was not impressed with the taste of the food. The food tasted ok, but nothing to rave about. From the deviled eggs to the grilled hanger-steak, they tasted normal, just not any better than other restaurants that I have eaten those dishes before. Actually, the deviled egg was a little tart, the spinach on the sides of the hanger-steak was too salty, and the steak was overcooked. Pizza looks like it came out of the frozen pizza box. The extra topping of Italian sausage that my friend request to be added on the pizza and the shrimp on the gambas al ajillo were bland. Food overall was unimpressive and not memorable. I’m just sharing my own experience…perhaps it is different for others.\nSince it was a Saturday night, the street was very lively and noisy with loud music. The same was true at this restaurant. It was however not too loud that you can’t have a conversation.\nAgain, the staff provided good service at the restaurant but since I’m just not impressed with the food, therefore I can’t recommend.']"
Loft Bar & Bistro,4.1,581,"[""CAUTION: Be very careful before booking here.\n\nWe had a deeply disappointing experience at The Loft by Capers. They engaged in bait-and-switch tactics when we called Capers to book a month in advance and, without warning much less asking for our approval, they set us up at The Loft which understaffed the event, and kept a portion of our food.\n\nInitially, we agreed on a price for a group of 60, with the corkage fee waived since we were considering other venues. When our group size dropped to 40 (due to issues with the east coast hurricane in early Oct 2024) they refused a price adjustment, which we accepted, but requested the food for the remaining 20 people to be packed for us. They agreed without issue.\n\nOn the day of the event, we are expecting to go to Capers East & Drink, that's where we called on day one, and they moved us to a completely different, rundown location in downtown San Jose (The Loft) without asking for approval. The venue was nothing like what we had seen on the pictures, it was dirty, scary location, with paid parking. Despite these frustrations, we decided to proceed as we had guests from all over the country.\n\nUpon arrival we dropped off wine for dinner, requesting that the white be chilled and the red kept cool. This simple task took over 30 minutes, and the red wine was left sitting out. The service was disorganized and inattentive throughout.\n\nWhen it came time to settle the bill, I asked for the leftover food as promised. They told me it was already given out, which was absolutely not the arrangement. The manager was not present but over the phone, Kan, was dismissive and rude, even accusing me of being drunk when I questioned where the rest of the food had gone. I insisted he could check with his staff to confirm I was not drunk, it did not matter.  He threatened to call the police if I didn’t pay the full bill.\n\nIt was a terrible experience—poor communication, unprofessionalism, and broken promises. Be careful if you’re considering this place, especially if you’re from out of town."", ""Great Place To Eat Drink And Dance Wonderful Atmosphere With A Great Staff Who's Willing To Go Above And Beyond To Make Sure Your Night Is A Wonderful Experience"", 'We were lucky to get a table as this place had three private parties going on. We managed to eat in the outdoor tent area which was cooler than inside but still ok. We each ordered appetizer size food and was a perfect amount for the not so hungry. Prawns were cooked perfectly and paired well with the mixed greens. Our waitress, Nicole, wasn’t so great. She poured a taste of wine and left the table with our bottle for all of us to pour ourselves. She was not attentive and seemed very quick to try and run away from us. We will be back for the food and hope we don’t sit in her section.', 'Had lunch here. Really enjoyed the food. Very cozy, clean, pleasant staff. Prices are very reasonable. Highly recommend crab stuffed salmon.', 'I used to eat here with some regularity before the pandemic and always enjoyed it.  My wife and I discovered that it had reopened last year and had dinner during one of the downtown resurgence events last fall.  They never disappoint.  Besides being a unique venue, the food and service are great. Tip: Eat outside on the patio when the weather is nice!\n\nLast week I had a class reunion there.  While the gathering was on the smaller side, less than 20 people, the management was very flexible with our accommodations.  All my classmates and their significant others all enjoyed the food, service and old school architecture.\n\nKeep up the good work.']"
BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse,4.2,2405,"['Opens early Sunday at 10 so went in as soon as they did.\n\nToday they only had happy hour and appetizers available for the first hour but that was fine.\n\nFries were unironically the best item minus the chicken wings. Rest was alright.', 'Deep Dish is Deep Bread\n\nI have loved deep dish pizza for decades, and always loved the ones at BJs. Unfortunately it is no longer deep dish, but deep bread. I have a lot of sadness. This is not worth the cost or the disappointment of thinking you’re going to bite into a delicious deep dish pizza sauce filling pan of goodness. Flavor is fine… just please make deep dish a deep dish? I’m not paying $40 for bread with toppings.\n\nThe onion rings were amazing. The avocado rolls were meh per no flavor... Broccoli cheddar soup was good.', 'This restaurant has a nice atmosphere.  Not only is it possible to watch sports, but children and young people can also go on dates.  The food was ordinary.  The beer at this restaurant is delicious.  Of course, it was a draft beer, and the Double IPA was impressive.  I plan to visit again just for the beer.', 'Oh my gosh!  So amazing!  The staff is awesome at the Market Center BJ’s.   The food and decor is great.  This 5 course beer Spooktoberfest is so much fun.  I fully recommend it.', 'The beer dinners are the the best. Spooktoberfest Dinner is always great. But the best part is Bo and the staff. The Beer is always fantastic and of course the food.']"
Rok Steakhouse & Grill,4.3,1582,"['Went there on Saturday evening and was able to a table without a reservation. There is seating both inside and outside with heaters. The concept is cooking on a 700 degree stone. The food was good, enjoyed the steak and the scallops as well as the sides. The inside was a bit loud, so it was a bit distracting even though the restaurant wasn’t super crowded. The wait staff was friendly and efficient. Would definable return.', 'This place really rocks, we came  here for my birthday celebration. Food was great service was great and our server Meng took really good care of us. I have never experienced sizzling hot steak right off the lava rock, it was amazing I will definitely go here again and again.

I was SORELY disappointed here.\n\nI ordered the Wagyu (think it was $45 of a 6 oz.) and a side of steamed broccoli.  There was absolutely no seasoning on the steak or the broccoli and the broccoli was still raw.  The steak was cooked appropriately, but I've had Wagyu and the claim that this was Wagyu seems dubious to me.  It seemed like a piece of cheap steak that, if it were well-seasoned, might have hid the fact that it wasn't Wagyu.  Makes sense considering the price.  The Wagyu I'd had before was significantly more expensive.  The Chimichurri Sauce on the side was good and made the steak edible, so I did finish the steak.  I didn't touch the broccoli.\n\nMy wife ordered the New York Strip.  Again, no seasoning at all.  She didn't care for the Chimichurri, so she didn't eat her steak at all.  We wound up giving it to a homeless person outside.  She got a side of shrimp with it that she said was decent, but for the price, she'd rather eat at Sizzlers.  The French Fries she got on the side were actually outstanding.  Perfectly cooked - crispy on the outside and soft inside.\n\nThe environment consisted of seat upholstery on its last legs and paint peeling on walls.  A little care into the decor might make me feel like I was a steakhouse.\n\nFinally, the servers were nice - very nice.  They were pleasant to talk to.  The host at the door seemed as though he did not want to be there and strained to give us a smile or even a nod.  When I stepped in, I asked for a booth for two people and he stared at me for a good ten seconds before I said I was ready to be seated and he ushered me to two booths telling me to pick the one I wanted.\n\nOverall, not worth the price.  We spent $120 on lunch with the tip and apart from my soda and my wife's water, the images are all we got (mind you, once we were done eating, so my steak isn't actually on the plate anymore)."", 'Ordered 2 one pound steaks. 2 alcoholic drinks, & a sundae. Steaks came with 2 sides each. The service was exceptional. Our server was on top of his game. Did a really good concept of explaining the concept of the restaurant: the steak is cooked on a hot rock. Kind of like k-bbq or pepper lunch? They pull it out on a cart. It’s sizzling. Food was good. A bit pricey but within reason. The types of meats are the type you’d find in a medium-high end restaurant. So, $60 per person is a good estimate for the bill. Vibes are nice. You really get the sense that the staff have a passion for what they do. Come here. Eat here. It’s good. 10/10']"
