GRIND THE NYC COFFEE SHOP & BAGEL HOUSE,4.5,714,"['There were so many coffee shops to choose from in this area and we are beyond happy we came to Grind. First of all the ambiance when you first walk in is nice from the color palettes of the chosen decor to shelves on the walls. We found a nice spot to sit at and the table were cleaned right away.  We actually got to meet the owner who is kind , personable, and passionate about his business. The baristas were very nice, fast and aware and accommodating of your needs. We were only to grab a coffee but ended up seeing the cream cheese selection and got breakfast here too. The orders came out quick and when we are in NY again we will come back.', 'First time to NYC.  We ate at a different bagel place for six days.  This was my top bagel out of the six!  I got an everything with the honey bacon cream cheese.  OMG, it was so freaking good.  A little heavier on the cream cheese than some places - I actually scraped some off.  But it was freaking phenomenal!  This is a must try for bagels and cream cheese.  Lots of options and a cute little cafe.  Macarons were good.  Coffee was pretty good too.', 'Got a bagel and a tea. The bagels are big, solid portion. The place looks nice but it’s pretty crowded and chaotic, the staff was running around trying to keep up with the orders. Had to wait for my bagel although the person ordering after me got theirs faster.\nAlthough the food was good, the staff is doing their best, I would not come back', 'Great space. Lots of choices. Tons of seating here.\n\nOat latte was okay - tasted much more like the oat than coffee. Needs extra shots.', 'What a gem! I’m staying in the neighborhood for a few days and set out this morning in search of a good pastry - and ultimately chose the Grind. After some perusing, I ordered their Greek Yogurt Cheese Danish (which appeared to have some jam in it as well) and an Americano. 10/10!! This pastry was fantastic. The jam was delicious and the cheese not too sweet. Felt like a dainty little cream-cheese-and-jelly sandwich for an adult?\n\nGreat start to the morning. Only shame is I didn’t get a photo before devouring the pastry. Try it!']"
Coffee Project New York | East Village,4.7,756,"['Small cage with outdoor and indoor seating. Cocoyam beans are quality and darker, more bitter roast for an intense coffee flavor. Staff are kind and helpful. They also have wifi for work and some pastries. I ordered the cinnamon roll which was perfection - lots of icing and fluffy and sweet. A bit pricey $6.50 but still worth it in my opinion. I wonder if they bake in house?\nI also ordered a decaf latte with oat milk and it was good. Tables inside are small and there is only one plug so hard to work from by I made it happen.', 'One of good coffee shop in NYC. I am pour over type so it ‘s difficult to find good one in NYC. This shop is good and variety of bean you can choose. The barista can do well and made it good. Seating area indoor and outdoor. Wifi are available. They also have bite food. Credit card accepted. Enjoy!', ""Stepped in quickly for a cold brew. I really enjoy the flavor of the cold brew, it's smooth and not acidic. I'm not a connoisseur but I can really taste the flavors of the coffee.\n\nThe shop itself was small but cute. There were tables and it was busy when I went. The staff seemed nice. I only stepped in for a short bit but will probably come back because the coffee was good and the atmosphere was nice."", 'There are other locations, but this location gives the best NYC experience with its cozy seating and patio. The espresso drinks are excellent and the pastries, too! The folks behind the counter were kind and patient. Well worth the walk from the subway.', ""I recently visited this café, and I have to say, the coffee was delicious! I really enjoyed my plain latte with almond milk—it was rich and flavorful. However, I did notice that the seating was limited, which made it a bit cramped.\n\nOne thing that surprised me was the 50-cent charge to make drinks iced. Is this a new trend in New York City? Additionally, paying over $7 for a hot latte felt a bit steep, and I wasn't thrilled about it. They also use Almond Breeze almond milk, which is the cheapest option out there.\n\nThey had a small case of pastries, but unfortunately, they didn’t look fresh.""]"
Culture Espresso,4.6,1674,"['Great coffee spot for true coffee enthusiasts. The service was fantastic too. We went there 3 times over two days and by then they already knew what we’d order and even what kind of milk we preferred in our drinks. Overall 5 star coffee and 5 star service. Cookies were also great! We will be back next time we take a trip to NYC', ""The award-winning chocolate cookie is definitely award-winning for a reason. The coffee is amazing and is worth the walk in the morning. The space in Culture Espresso is pretty limited, and usually, the line is out the door. If you're visiting, you may want to get a souvenir."", 'Culture Espresso is most definitely a place to look out for during your stay in New York City! I love this lowkey cafe in the bustling city. The workers were very pleasant and inviting. Apparently, these cookies have been ranked as the best in the city. And I absolutely believe it. The chocolate chip cookie was one of the best I have ever had in my life. It was so crunchy on the exterior with the gooiest, most chocolately center. It was sweet and rich in flavor as well. I also had a great latte with some elegant latte art. This place is quite pricey, but entirely worth it!', 'Went here for the chocolate chip cookie and was not disappointed.  The cookie was warm with perfectly melted  chocolate.  The outside of the cookie was delightfully crispy with a perfectly gooey inside.  One of the best cookies I have ever had.  It was light but packed with flavor.  It was not too sweet and made you want to go back for more.  Unlike some other cookies that are rich and dense, these cookies leave you with the feeling of not just wanting to go back for more but also that you have room for more.  A dangerous combo. I highly recommend.', 'Great coffee. Super nice baristas. The place is small, not ideal for sit down. But it’s to go place. I got cappuccino and my wife got mocha. Great drinks! So well crafted. The mocha is flavorful and rich. We didn’t try the award winning cookies but they smell and look amazing. Great little coffee shop to grab coffee on the go']"
SUITED,4.7,479,"['A charming coffee spot offering a great selection of beans from both local roasters like SEY and international roasters like subtext & Apollon’s Gold, and their pour-over is a definite highlight. While the space is compact, there are a few tables available for seating, though laptop use is generally discouraged.', 'At first I was like, “$16 for a burrito?!” Now I’m like “burrito”.\n\nAmazing! Great coffee, great service, delicious burrito with the highlight being the salsa served with it! Glad we came!', ""Suited is a great spot in FiDi to sip a variety of drinks (coffee-based and non) while doing some work or having a break with a pastry.\n\nThey roast their coffee, which is always a plus and an aspect that defines their products' quality and passion for it. The staff is super friendly, and the owner is always keen to chat about soccer—spoiler: He's a Juventus fan!\n\nI'll see you soon!"", 'Excellent espresso and cappuccino! Tasteful interior and nice and friendly staff. Their international roasters selection is top notch. Looking forward to trying their food. So far very tasty peanut cookie.', 'Amazing vibes at this spot. Enjoyed an excellent flat white, delicious burrito, and some spot on tea. Definitely stop by this shop!']"
Gumption Coffee,4.5,185,"['Wonderful shop and wonderful staff!  Great coffee too.  We stayed at a hotel nearby and Julian gave us the best recommendations for things to see and do in NYC.  Thanks for your helpfulness!', 'Cute atmosphere, but not much seating. The croissant was good and service very friendly and prompt. My capuccino was on a hotter side and not so much foam. $1 add on for non fairy milk is a rip off in my opinion.', ""There aren't a lot of coffee places in this area, and this is as good as it gets. Service is friendly, but virtually no selection of pastries; mostly coffee, water and yogurt. Place is eh."", ""Decent coffee, but nothing to write home about.  They couldn't make it as hot as you'd want so they end up adding hot water on top.  Coffee flavor is good but doesn't stand out.  Limited, ready-made food options.  Walkable to a number of areas.  Coffee is pricey."", 'Great Coffee, But Disappointing Service Policy\n\nI recently visited for some coffee, and while the coffee itself was amazing, my experience was marred by an issue with cleanliness. I needed to wash my hands, but unfortunately, the sanitizer machine wasn’t working. There was a small basin nearby, but the employees informed me that guests weren’t allowed to use it. I completely understand that policy, but as a paying customer, I was disappointed that they couldn’t make an exception in this situation.\n\nThe barista was very kind and offered napkins, which was appreciated, but it wasn’t quite the same as actually washing my hands. It felt a bit off-putting that despite being a customer, I wasn’t able to use a basic amenity when it was needed. Hopefully, they can improve the accessibility to handwashing options in the future.']"
Stumptown Coffee Roasters,4.5,1576,"['Interesting place connected to the Ace Hotel. Order your beverage and relax in the lobby. Filled with antiques, smooth music on the speakers.\nThe rose honey coffee was a bit too sweet, the matcha tea is creamy and delicious.', 'Excellent coffee. To me I would consider it as one of the best coffee roster within New York.\nIf you there do not miss  it', ""I ordered a rose cardamom tea latte. I saw a picture of a latte art or rose on it, but I couldn't find it at all, which was a shame. There was no particular taste, and the staff was not friendly"", 'Good small coffee place. Nice coffee for those who prefer their beverages  with almond milk or non-diary options. Loved the coffee', 'Always a great cappuccino! Cute coffee shop with standing room and lounge seating in hotel. I met my boyfriend (now fiance) here on a first date 6 years ago, went back last week and was happy to see it still thriving. The general manager Anna even helped my fiance organize a proposal by serving us drinks in custom mugs! Such helpful staff that helped make the moment special!']"
Variety Coffee Roasters,4.4,512,"['It’s quiet in here, with ambient, bluesy-styled music playing at a volume that could probably permit an intelligible phone conversation. Eight of the 13 or so tables are occupied by remote workers. I don’t know how long they would be welcome to stay on and continue working.\n\nThere are several outdoor tables, but only two are under cover. There is standing room at a few coffee counters by the windows.\n\nThe drip coffee is smooth and fruity today. I paid $3 for what I think is a 12 oz. cup. Where can you find a $5 latte and an Americano for $3.50? Here! They also have simple syrup and vanilla bean syrup at the milk station to sweeten iced drinks in no time.\n\nThough I found the banana walnut bread to be pleasantly edible (at least it was very moist), I wouldn’t seek out Variety for its pastry offerings.', 'I love the coffee and the atmosphere here. Some more attractive visuals of the products could really make everything stand out even more. If you ever need help improving that, I’d be happy to assist. I’ll definitely be coming back!', 'At their Lexington Avenue and 85th Street store I tried their oatmeal raisin cookie ($3.24 including tax). It had a mild flavor but managed to be pleasing to a limited degree (a 7.5 rating on a scale of 1 to 10).', 'I’m a driver who mostly drives in this neighborhood. Some businesses or doormen know me by face.  I use this location a few times per week. Sometimes the other location at Park Row. Most of the time I wash my hands before getting my coffee especially when the barista is busy with someone or with cleaning.\nToday around 7:10pm I walk it. The barista was busy with a customer so I decided to use the bathroom first. Besides it’s a time saving for me. He jumped out from behind his desk and stopped me saying that I can’t use the bathroom, I have to buy something first. I never saw him before: a very short guy (compare to me), kind of Hispanic or Native American with a strange face expression.(Like I took his lands. He doesn’t look like a barista at all, more like construction guy).\nI was shocked and asked him what does he mean and when he repeated his policy I explained him that I need a coffee but wanted to wash my hands first. That sounded very strange for him so I got my coffee (strange but I tipped him) , told him that all the people sitting there are customers like me and he can’t tell anyone what to do first or how to do it. Then I used the bathroom (just hand washing) and left the coffee shop with an unpleasant feeling. Too many idiots in this city.', 'Cute, busy little coffee bar off Lexington 4/5/6. Has all the little accoutrements that you’d want in a true coffee bar: the bar itself, water on the side, a vanilla bean steeped simple syrup, and good baristas. The latte was a bit foamy for me, and the croissant was decent. Lots of seating, everyone on their laptops (even on the weekend mamma mia 🤌🏽)']"
Abraço,4.4,839,"['Love the vibe here- but cannot bring laptops. No nondairy milk which is a bummer but I normally don’t like black iced coffee and I liked theirs. The flat bread (cheese, onion, tomato) was warm and the Perfect Little snack - not a full meal but just enough to satisfy!!! Will definitely be back.', 'This place has become a very special spot for me. Espresso is always top notch, rotation of baked goods are freshly made and creative, & prices are amazingly reasonable. The atmosphere is classy, cool and moody in all the right ways. I love that it’s not trying to be flashy or trendy. Seems like there is a true appreciation of community and culture here! Perfect place for writing, reading or catching up with a friend. This place is seriously amazing. Try their espresso + olive oil cake.', 'It’s easy to have a bad experience here. They are very serious about their business and fundamentally unlike other American cafes that people are “used to”. No laptops allowed and no alternative milks are the things that confuse people the most. I live in the area and I was frustrated in my first couple experiences here. But once you get over yourself and start to appreciate this incredibly serious, genuine, and proud small business for what it is, there is nowhere like it that I’ve ever been. They aren’t overtly trendy or trying to imitate somewhere else, they are fundamentally, purely masters of their own craft. Best espresso I’ve ever had. Lovely, subtle pastries. And a warm, relaxed vibe perfect to catch up with a friend or read a novel while you have your coffee.', 'Cozy coffee shop down a few stairs- make sure you don’t walk past it! There are charming artworks on the wall for sale. I loved the Little Icey, it was the perfect amount of espresso! There are bathrooms available for customers and there is seating inside and out.', 'Just about the best ice latte I’ve had in NYC. Very strong and just delicious! Also vibe is super chlill and vitagy:)']"
St Kilda Coffee,4.6,604,"['A haven for good coffee in a neighborhood chock full of Starbucks. No line, easy to get in and out with a filter coffee and to be on your way for the day.

I did not see a wheelchair accessible entrance.', 'Nice little spot. Thought I’d try a flight but the only advice I got from the barista was “we only have one espresso” and when it came the sparkling water was flat (plus there was only an .oz of it at most). The espresso was very bitter, but the Columbia & Rwandan brewed coffees were delicious. If you offer flights it’s worth putting the effort in to make the experience worth the $.', 'Being from Melbourne, this place really hits home with its coffee culture. Simple set up made for brilliant coffee.\n\nFlat whites did not disappoint.', 'Hidden bellow the streets of New York, St Kilda has some KILLER coffee. I got the dirty chai and my dad got a double shot latte. The coffee they’re using is fresh and superb. More than anything else however, the atmosphere is so fun. Walking down the steps out of the city and into this cafe is, simply put: magical.', ""Some of the best coffee I've ever had!

Highly recommended🙌"", 'Every time we visit NYC, we find a new-to-us coffee shop because NYC does GREAT coffee. Although a local chain, Bird & Branch does not disappoint.

There are a few seats and tables inside their beautiful and bright space.', 'I love the specialty coffees here—the Blackbird was delicious.

Black Fox Coffee,4.5,1017,"['I’ve been a loyal customer of Black Fox for quite some time and have always enjoyed their excellent coffee and delicious breakfast sandwiches. One of my favorite aspects was that the breakfast sandwich came with a side salad included, which made the meal feel complete and justified the higher price point of $16\n\nHowever, on my recent visit, I was disappointed to find that the side salad is no longer included and now has to be purchased separately. This change feels like a step back in terms of value and customer appreciation. It seems more like a move to increase profits rather than enhance the customer experience.\n\nWhile I still appreciate the quality of their coffee and food, the removal of the side salad diminishes the overall value of the meal for me. I hope the management reconsiders this decision. Until then, I’m adjusting my rating from 5 stars to 2 stars.', 'Can’t comment about the drinks, but I can comment about the chocolate chip cookie. Very mediocre. Dry. Almost a red light consistency. I’m not sure if it’s because they are baked fresh during the week and served on the weekend or this is there desired consistency and taste?', 'I got to enjoy the most delicious coffee and matcha at black fox! The staff was super friendly and enthusiastic, they spoke knowledgeably about their drinks. Very happy with my experience, will be visiting all the time!', 'I had an incredibly disappointing experience at Black Fox Coffee. I ordered the avocado smash and ended up waiting **40 minutes** for my order. When it finally arrived, the eggs were completely undercooked.

I just wish this location had more seating so that it can be fully enjoyed.', 'I gave 4 out of 5 stars because of the overall experience. I want to start by saying my mom is addicted to their hot cocoa. She tried many in NYC and she wanted to come back here for more. I ordered the $13 hand brew coffee, but since I am not a coffee head, maybe I could be biased, I don’t think it’s worth it at all. The wait was kinda long and the customers were kinda snobbish.

The lighting in the shop was mainly natural, pouring in through skylights, and large windows. The entire space visually comfortable and inviting. One more thing, I have to mention was about the restroom. It’s designed with the same aesthetic as the rest of the shop and was equipped with disposable towels and a fresh floral scent that’s pleasantly natural, not chemical.\n\nI ordered a washed Kubi coffee from Ethiopia. When it was served, it came with three cups. The first was a glass of sparkling water, the second was a high-temperature coffee, and the third was a medium-temperature coffee. At the higher temperature, the Kubi had a dominant citrus acidity, bitterness, and aroma. After sipping some sparkling water to cleanse the palate, I noticed that the aftertaste lingered subtly, offering a distinct contrast between the two states. By the time I got to the third cup, the fruity notes became more pronounced, and the acidity was noticeably less intense than in the second cup.', 'I’ve been hearing about Sey Coffee for a while but never had enough time to visit their main cafe in Brooklyn until now.

When you dine in they serve it on a little wooden tray with some water on the side. The water was sparkling which I didn’t really care for but the coffee was perfect. It really hit the spot on a hot summer day.\n\nFlavor wise this does start very floral and citrusy but as you drink more the flavors become more mellow and smooth.

As someone who is more into dark roasts, I found this light roast cortado to be pretty good and had a lot of caffeine. The lack of syrups I’m sure was an intentional choice but the honey and sugar was provided at a self service area. I will have to say the cold brew was quite sour but I would love to give their cortado another shot when I’m in the area.', 'Easily the greatest coffee shop in LA in terms of quality. There is precision in everything they do from the roasting to brewing and you can chat with their baristas to learn why you had such a great experience drinking their coffee.\nI ordered a short Americano and the moment I had the first sip, I realized I had discovered heaven of coffee lovers in Art District.\nWhen I looked on their social media, I saw that they had a branch in Istanbul which then made me realized why their name is so familiar. I had tried their great coffee in Istanbul!', 'If you need to drink a great coffee at the hands of a professional barista, then you should go to this wonderful coffee shop. They know how to prepare coffee perfectly. Also, this place is beautiful and comfortable to spend some time in. The only problem is that they do not accept cash payment.', 'Great hang out cafe with warm bright atmosphere.\nTheir cold brew is not my fav so will probably try a different drink next time; had a funny taste for my palette.\nVegan chocolate chip cookie dough s $5 and okay, but probably won’t order again.  I liked its chalky dryness, but found it too salty (even after scraping the crystalised salt off).']"
THE HISTORY COFFEE,4.8,161,"['Amazing, friendly, delicious! We had turkey pesto croissant, several sweet treats, espresso, and fancy cold banana latte.

Thanks to the 100s of reviews to help me find this coffee shop gem!', 'Amazing breakfast place with 💯 service! Can’t explain how much I loved everything - sandwiches, bakes and drinks! I had to leave a review right after eating - only pity was that I had to get them to go. Will defo recco everyone to give this place a try!', 'I love love love this coffee shop!! I got the sparking rose, it was a hot day and I was in dire need of a refreshing drink and this was just perfect. It wasn’t too sweet nor was bland but just the perfect mixture of floral essence and quenching sparklingness (if that’s a word).\n\nI def recommend this if you don’t drink caffeine of giving it a break!', 'I fail to possess the proper adjectives to describe the kindness and warmth of this coffee shop. Carefully crafted snacks and drinks, fantastic coffee & dog friendly staff makes for an amazing environment. It’s a beautiful spot to study, meet friends or hang out for some people watching. The staff is thoughtful and will remind patrons about alternate-side parking to save you a ticket! Best coffee shop in the neighborhood, without a doubt.', 'I just need to give this cafe its flowers because they have made such an impact in my life. Each time I walk in I am always greeted with the kindest hellos and the best cup of coffee. The owners and all their employees are the sweetest and I’ve never felt so welcomed in a coffee shop. I’ve brought countless friends and family here and have spent afternoons laughing and sometimes even crying!  I even got engaged here! I got the surprise of my life when the owners played our song as my fiancé proposed, smiling and clapping as they watched. This place has my heart. If you’re a coffee lover and appreciate kindness, this is the place to go. I’m a LA native and have been to just about every coffee shop you can think of and this one is a gem. They just gifted me a coffee mug for their three year anniversary and I knew I had to leave this review. Thank you so much History. I adore you guys!']"
Document Coffee Bar,4.6,476,"['I loved the atmosphere it was really cool to walk in and see all the photos. The espresso was definitely very different from what i’ve had it was very sour but not under i loved the fruit notes it was good and got no over extraction! I got a flat white, & the cocoa nibs shake was fire', 'While this cafe may seem out of the way around the mid Wilshire area, it’s actually quite perfectly placed in the bustling neighborhood. It seems fitted mostly for grab and go now with very minimal seating and just a few spots with counter space. It’s a shotgun style space; long and narrow with a neat patio area that juts out into the parking lot (which I had no clue of until I walked back there after parking on the metered street).\nThe coffee selection is robust as the coffee itself. Plenty of options for both espresso and tea. They also carry a good amount of pantry items. Though they were a bit too random for a usual coffee stop for me.\n\nI tried their signature Mad Spice latte which was filled with a variety of spices that really made the latte bloom so I was quite surprised and happy that after the initial harsh first sip, the rest went down smooth.\n\nThere is a pastry bin but it seems to typically run out after the morning and lunch rush. So I didn’t get to try anything (and I’m not a big scones fan which were the two items left).\n\nAnd that’s Document in a nutshell. A quick go to spot to get your Java and a pastry and be on your way. From photos of the past it seems like they used to have more tables and seating but now it’s just bare. I personally like a cafe I can get comfortable in and relax for a while. This just isn’t one of them.\nNot their fault, they’re catering to the workers all along Wilshire by providing what they need most, good quality coffee.', 'Blink once and you might miss this place. It\'s on the corner of an office building on a residential street. But don\'t miss out on this if you\'re looking for a serious coffee shop in Ktown, and not one of those ""coffee"" places that has drinks that are more instagrammable than drinkable. Don\'t get me wrong, i enjoy them once in a while, but if you\'re a coffee afficionado, this is the place.\n\nTheir latte is good, a bit on the hotter side but that the foam stayed thick and creamy. The cortado though was more of a macchiato, still good. Bummer they don\'t have coffee cups for inside, just to go cups.\n\nLoved the minimalist interior accented by the gallery wall of people. It almost feels like an art gallery with a coffee shop instead of the other way round.', 'Excellent coffee spot.\nTo compare two different coffees I have tried one pourover and one flatwhite.\nThe house bland is extraordinary- with an oat milk it was perfectly made to the nice balanced coffee!\nWill come back and recommend to anyone.\nFreat space inside. Very modern - coffee shop kind of place, very spatial! Nice exhibition too!!!', 'Cool cafe on a side street.  Worth a visit.  Great coffee, pastries, art.']"
Maru Coffee,4.6,485,"['I heard this spot was popular in another city and I wanted to check it out.\n\nThe location isn’t at your typical plaza, it’s setup near a busy street heading toward the freeway. I had their chocolate chip cookie and a matcha latte hot with whole milk.  The matcha was excellent, perfect temperature and flavor. The cookie was also phenomenal. Overall it was an excellent breakfast time snack.\n\nI’d definitely come back here again. Street parking can get pretty tight during peak times and traffic times.', 'This coffee shop was so good that I came two days in a row on my recent trip to LA. I heard good things about this place online and after visiting it lives up to the hype.\n\nThe coffee here is really high quality and done in small batches (you can even see their roasting setup behind one of the doors). Beyond just delicious coffee, they also have whimsical signature drinks like the cream top iced espresso which won me over. It was the perfect blend of acidity in the coffee with creaminess from the foam and spices on top. If you’re not in the mood for coffee, the matcha here is exceptionally well made too.\n\nAesthetically the inside and outside of this shop are beautiful which makes visiting or working here great. It’s located in the Arts District near other popular shops so make the trip out.', 'I’ve been coming to this Maru for years, even before they started roasting in-house, so I’m finally giving the review they deserve. The first thing that strikes you is that even when the place is packed (which it often is), there’s a bright tranquility to the space; usually including good music and an air of creative energy from people working and collaborating while sipping their cream tops. I became a cult follower of their almond milk matcha latte, but their core competency lies truly in their phenomenal espresso. If you brew at home, you can’t leave without a bag of their beans. Overall, this coffee sanctuary has been and will continue to be one of my must-visits every time I’m back in LA.', 'Good music and drinks but uncomfortable chairs and definitely not a place to work unless you are very very short and can use the low table or you are able to get one of the three chairs at the bar. The ricotta pastry looked great but was too sweet and didn’t  have any ricotta that you could taste.', 'Hip coffee spot in an industrial area with virtually no easy parking. The coffee is very good, though if one doesn’t like strong fruit notes in their coffee then this place is probably not for you. The minimalist ambiance was very cool and the croissant was excellent. I would say that Maru is a solid coffee shop but probably somewhat overhyped.']"
Blackwood Coffee Bar,4.3,258,"[""The girl attendance was rushing me out asking all the time if I was done with my order, not giving me enough time to decide.

And the price is super expensive, $11.50 for a  banana brand slice and the same price for the croissant. And she not even asked if I was going to eat there or to go, and placed everything in the paper bag, like she wants to say goodbye don't come back.

Definitely coming back here to get in the state of flow ☀️', 'The owner, Keith I believe, was passive aggressive.

This is their main location but they also do pop ups at the smorgasbord in downtown Los Angeles as well.', 'Cute spot, good vibes, nice staff. The standouts for me here were the corn latte which was excellent and the fact that there is an enclosure for kids haha. Not only did they enjoy it but they could be a little loud and nobody really can tell 😁', 'Love the ever changing seasonal menu drinks. It’s the brilliant mind of the owner, Frank La, who also happens to be the US barista champion this year. Love the fall pumpkin pie latte with the vivid cream latte being my favorite staple.

Will definitely keep on coming!', 'Did you know that the barista that owns this coffee shop is a 2024 world-class barista champion!!\nOfc we had to try the coffee - we have not gone to the standalone shop just came to the booth at the Smorgasboard in Los Angeles.

I loved their mini-cups for kiddos!\n\nThey have assorted pastries, and our chocolate croissant and morning bun may be amongst the best I have ever had anywhere.\n\nThis place is small, so expect a line and a wait.', 'Loquat, similar to Stereoscope, is clearly a coffee lover’s café. When there are multiple espresso and pour over options from the get, you’re in the right place. When I visited I got their summer blend espresso (Guatemalan + Ethiopian). It was close to closing so they were out of pastries, but that’s alright. The baristas were all friendly and working hard at fulfilling orders and cleaning up shop. The branding of the space was great, from all the yellow details (their brand color) of the interior, down to their cup sleeves and coffee bags (of which I left with one). This is surely an LA café that I will return to the next time I’m in town.', 'Coffee is absolutely on point. Potentially the best flat white I’ve had in LA and the matcha latte is pretty amazing too.', 'Does not live up to the hype. It’s a fine cafe, but after waiting in line, dealing with the crowd, paying the expensive price for the coffee, I left feeling very underwhelmed. One of their signatures, the Marscapone, was a bit too sweet and gave me the impression that I could have just made it at home. One argument for this cafe is that they use good bean. In that case, maybe avoid their signature drinks. The space itself is uninspired, making this cafe overall lack a sort of “it” factor of any kind.', 'This was a very nice shop. Love the aesthetic! As I was waiting in line I was seeing their beautiful drinks. It looked so fancy like it came straight out of a magazine! Loved the atmosphere.\n\nIf this wasn’t a small business I’d ask for my money back I didn’t even drink more than one sip (if you’re wondering why it looks emptier, it’s because I asked for no ice). The flat white tasted like water and oatmilk. I actually like to taste my coffee so I was disappointed by that. Plus it was a lot of coffee grounds in my cup. 🥺']"
Velo Coffee,4.8,53,"[""I tried a matcha latte and an everything jalapeño cream cheese croissant here--both were delicious. I was especially happy to find that the matcha was unsweetened (which can be hard to find), and you have the option to add a sweetener or omit it entirely. They offer a variety of plant-based milks, and overall, the matcha was very flavorful.\n\nThe café also had a great selection of pastries, including some vegan and gluten-free options. The staff was friendly and helpful, which made for a positive experience. I visited on a Sunday around 9 AM and there was no line, which was a nice bonus.\n\nIt's a very modern and small place, but you can sit down outside at the tables provided in the middle of the outdoor area of the shopping center. I wouldn't recommend it as a place to study or work from, but it's perfect for relaxing while enjoying your coffee and pastries.\n\nOne thing to note is that it can be a bit tricky to find if you're following Google Maps--you'll need to walk down the stairs or take an elevator from street level, as it's located just below a shopping center. Overall, I definitely recommend checking it out."", 'La Velo is the best thing to come to Silverlake in a while. The coffee is always fresh hot or cold and There is always a wide variety of teas available.

The coffee is simply exceptional, with a range of unique and flavorful options that cater to all tastes. Whether I'm in the mood for a classic latte or an adventurous specialty drink, Tierra Mia never disappoints. From the first sip to the last, the quality and attention to detail shine through, making each cup an absolute pleasure. If you're a coffee lover seeking an extraordinary cafe experience, Tierra Mia Coffee is a must-visit."", 'According to my barista, the horchata latte is most popular here so I had the hot version with oat milk. It was good, but for comparison, my friend got the exact same thing iced, and hers was way better. I don’t think their steamer wand was fully working because my drink was lukewarm, so maybe that’s why.\n\nThe pastries all look delicious and are reasonably priced. I got the chocolate tres leches muffin which was somewhere between a brownie and cake, and super milky at the center like tres leches cake usually is.\n\nCafes are my go-to study places, and Tierra Mia was good enough. I feel like it’s not cozy or comfortable enough to become my usual place, but I will come back for the iced horchata latte.', 'Little spot in Echo park, nice atmosphere.

I would go there right now for a delicious iced blood orange espresso, but I only have cash money to spend on ‘extras’ this week and they don’t take it. I understand why businesses choose to operate as cashless but I think this is a classist protocol in general and find it hard to believe that businesses are allowed to refuse official government tender, unless the customer employs a ‘middleman’ to broker the transaction. That’s the only reason I give the Service four stars. The employees deserve ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️', 'We went to this cute little coffee shop. We couldn’t really walk-in to the coffee shop so we got in line and ordered some coffee and two bakery items. I thought it was interesting that they offered an option to make the coffee pink so I ended up getting it. It was only food coloring rather than flavor but nonetheless still interesting to try out. When I asked about the coffee, the employee at the register was very mechanical and explained what a Gibraltar and Cappuccino were in terms of fluid ounces. I ended up ordering a Pink Cappuccino. We also bought two croissants - spinach and artichoke croissant and a sweeter croissant. They were both incredibly flaky and quite tasty. It was buttery yet didn’t leave an after taste.

It was a beautiful day, so we decided to take a seat. The sun felt amazing! Our order was ready in less than 5 minutes. Our first sip was mind-blowing delicious! It was sooooo yummy!

They typically have selections from 10-15 different global vendors. Whereas places like Verve and Blue Bottle will have a couple of bags of their own roasts, Kumquat has some of their own, but then you’ll find roasters from South Korea, Scandinavia, other US states, and more.\n\nThe coffee served at the cafe is always phenomenal, but the only thing that is unfortunate about this space (as was mentioned in other reviews) is that there’s no proper seating area. There’s a makeshift area just outside, with what seems like patio furniture, but I’m referring to real nice seating you would expect of a cafe. For that I’ll have to try their newer DTLA location.\n\nBottom line – the Highland Park Kumquat is the golden standard for variety of coffee beans they carry.

It’s always very burnt tasting and the ratios are all over the place. I used to be a barista and I’m honestly astounded that there aren’t more bad reviews. A cappuccino shouldn’t burn your mouth at the first sip - the milk is always scalding hot and over steamed. I think they need some better training to learn how to get proper micro foam. I’m really not that fussy in most places but I can’t believe how terrible something as simple as a cappuccino is from a coffee shop. I’ve ordered one at least a dozen of times stupidly expecting it to get better.\n\nTheir sandwiches are usually good - but all of the pastries I’ve tried have been pretty mediocre/bad.\n\nThe only drink I’ve had a pretty consistently good experience with is a Matcha, but they over sweeten it so I ask for just a tiny bit of it.\n\nThe patio is beautiful and it’s really lovely to sit out there.\n\nAgain I don’t want to leave this review to create a negative impact on this business, I only hope they take it seriously to better their service and quality.', 'By far my favorite coffee shop in LA!

I'd get it again, but I don't think it's worth going here just for a donut.\n\nI think most of my opinion comes down to the military latte. Without taking price into account, the drink was decent.

We had something similar in another cafe a couple of days prior for quite a bit less. Then there’s the tipping in coffee shops thing. Not being from the US this was new to me, and the last time I was here it wasn’t a thing. Restaurants, yes. Coffee shops, no, because I’m more than happy to get my purchase from the counter myself and I don’t think a 20% tip is justifiable.

I have been going to Tout Suite for over 10 years now and generally enjoy the food including their cakes, but the service with this transaction was so awful that I had to write a review.\n\nWhile I received a prompt email response from the director of catering after my initial inquiry, there was complete radio silence after I gave her what details I wanted in the cake. No suggestions on design or quotes on pricing.\n\nAfter not hearing back for 5 days and with my husband’s birthday party approaching, I finally called the catering service directly. I was able to place my order and was told I would receive a follow up invoice email.\n\nAgain, NO COMMUNICATION for another 2 days. No email confirmation of my design or how much the cake would cost. I had to call multiple times during business hours since the phone line was busy, and the voicemail system was not set up. When I finally reached someone, I was told that “your email was written down incorrectly” (even though I had already been communicating with them for nearly a week at this point).\n\nI finally received the invoice and reiterated over the phone that I needed this cake to be ready for pickup at 10:30 AM on a Sunday. The earliest time available was 12 PM but catering offered to make the cake Saturday night so it would be ready at 10:30 AM instead. I had no problems with that and gave the go ahead.\n\nSunday rolls around and my friend is at Tout Suite to pick up the cake and is told the kitchen is running behind and it’s going to be an extra 20 minutes. Clearly this cake was not made Saturday night like they had promised. She had to wait over 30 minutes before it was ready.\n\nFurthermore, it was very clear this was a slap dash effort as the cake I received was nowhere near the quality of the inspiration photo. I had asked for the cake to be in red and white without the rice paper decoration, but it was missing splattered gold accents and additional decoration on the side. I have attached both the inspiration photo and the cake I received for comparison as well as the invoice itemizing the details.\n\nThe only saving grace was the cake still tasted great but for the price that I paid, this subpar quality is unacceptable. The delay in the cake pickup also really affected my event which was scheduled at a batting cage and thus time sensitive.\n\nI cannot in good conscience recommend this bakery to anyone else since their customer service was downright horrendous and made every step of the process painfully stressful.']"

Un Caffe,4.6,266,"['I went to Un Caffe and ordered a cold brew with caramel foam.

The drink itself was very sweet and lacked the coffee flavor cold brew usually provides. 2.4/5. Overall, if you’re just looking to get coffee and go, this is not the place for you.

This is a problem when she doesn’t use measuring cup, she possibly poured too much for the other customers, but again it’s just plain laziness.\n\nSure enough when we had our matcha latte, they tasted just like hot oat milk. 🥛☹️\n\nAlso, they don’t have soy milk.\n\nAlso the bakery doesn’t look as good as they were shown on the google image.

We came on a Saturday which was probably our first fault. Line reached out the door, but that was more of a good sign at first to us! Then, we got towards the cashier. The customer in front of us gave the cashier a bit of an attitude for some reason, which I guess put the cashier in a bad mood. I was hoping to rush my order with the cashier to try and help speed things up and make her feel more at ease but it seems to have not helped her feelings towards the interaction. We didn’t get much of a welcoming vibe or apology for the way she was feeling, which would have been understandable if she did. But anyway, we ordered our coffee then we waited. It is very very crowded inside and we kept getting bumped around every time we moved. This is not a place to study or even lounge inside for a long period of time. (At least on the weekend) I feel there should be some rules in place to maybe combat this but that’s just my opinion. The drinks were really good to me, better than Starbucks and better than the surrounding coffee shops near me. This place is better for a DoorDash order/pickup, not for hanging out inside. Our drinks also came out pretty quickly, it was just the atmosphere that made it seem like we were waiting longer than we were.\nTL;DR: Great coffee, bad indoor lounging spot.', 'I am a huge coffee person and love to find a good spot that has great coffee AND food and Oso has it all!

If you ever want to come in and nerd out over coffee, their staff will help answer any questions and show you what beans they have available for purchase as well.\n\nThe cafe itself is well taken care of, always clean and well lit. It feels light and open as they have many windows to let in a lot of natural light.

While there is an outdoor patio with tables and chairs, there is no indoor seating, and all orders are taken from either a walk-up window or drive-thru window. Parking is a bit of an issue as there are only two parking spots, with one of them being a handicap space, so you\'ll most likely need to find street parking if not going through the drive-thru.\n\nSpace issues aside, for such a small shop, they have a menu with a wide variety of options that includes your standard coffee options, several kinds of tea, kombucha, smoothies, and seasonal coffee concoctions in addition to a small selection of pastries, tacos, and other small bites. I had the iced horchata latte, which was absolutely delicious and which I highly recommend. Unfortunately, they were out of tacos when I was there so I did not end up sampling any food.\n\nThe only reason I give this 4 stars rather than 5 is because of the lack of indoor seating and ordering windows. I went on a rainy day and had to knock on the ""employees only"" door to order because the walk-up window, while having a fabric tarp over it, would still have gotten me soaked had I ordered from there. It would be good if they could relocate the walk-up window to underneath the covered patio or put a more substantial covering over the area where the current window is so that one can order regardless of the elements at the time. Additionally, due to the lack of indoor seating and associated outlets, this is a spot definitely more for reading and socializing than working. That, however, doesn\'t stop it from being a good place to pick up some coffee on the go or to hang out with friends.', ""An absolute must try if you're in the area AND if you're a dog mom looking for a new spot to enjoy some coffee with your Day 1.

The flavors are there, the vibes are amazing, and the baristas are so kind and take the time to explain what goes into what we're ordering every time we get something new :) Don't live too close to here but always worth the drive and the drinks being oatmilk based always makes it easy to bulk buy for a solid supply!"", 'I’m hesitant to write such a glowing review only bc I (selfishly) want to keep this gem to myself.

I’ve frequented coffee establishments all over the country and this is one of the best.', 'This place is insanely good. The coffee here, iced, hot, to go, or dine in is so good. The employees are very nice and the back seating is very pretty.\nIf I could give this place a 10/5 stars, I would.

Great customer service and atmosphere 🥰🫶🏼✨\n\nI ordered the Lavendar Latte ☕️ And that was delicious. Diego and Emi had the best customer service and vibe. They were so upbeat and positive.

You can be inside in the AC or outside under the umbrellas. WiFi is available. Def a place where you can get work done 💻\n\nParking available in the parking lot. 🅿️ $5 parking but Slowpokes validate it 🙌🏽 Again another plus for customer service and thinking about how to care for the customers needs.\n\n❌Don’t park on the street because you will get towed. Those spots are for Levy Park visitors.\n\nOverall, this was a great experience, Levy park is near by, and I’ll be back. 😊🙌🏽', 'One of my favorite coffee shops in Houston, I stop here once a week or so. They are always really nice and very accommodating, plus their drinks are delicious! Their seasonal flavors are always wonderful. I like the coffee so much I recently bought a bag of whole bean! The coffee beans were uniformly roasted and very fresh! Roast date was within 5 days of the date of purchase. It made for wonderful at-home espresso and cold brew! Will continue to go back to this shop regularly.', 'Got the raspberry mocktail and chicken salad salad, both were great. Wi-Fi was fast. Came to edit and study, so it was a good environment for that.

In short, the coffee wasn't too impressive.\n\nOn the plus side, the service here was good and quick, and the atmosphere was very good. This place is located right next to a really vibrant and fun community park and the inside of the cafe has a nice ambiance plus good outdoor seating.

They did not have water glasses due to not having time to do dishes.\n\nThe space inside is very small, which made it feel a bit cramped, especially since they were quite busy during my visit. It seemed like they had some trouble keeping up with the demand, but despite the wait, the quality of both the food and drinks was worth it.\n\nThat said, I’d recommend this place more for grab-and-go orders or enjoying the outdoor seating area.

I ordered an iced coffee and a Kolache. The coffee was well flavored and balanced. I also had tried a caramel iced latte and it was also very good and not too sweet and sugary like most other places. As far as regular iced coffee goes, this is above average 3.8/5. The Kolache, a soft doughy pastry with a crispy outer shell was a great pairing with my coffee. Sweet, but not to sweet. I just wish it was a bit warmer. 3.2/5. I am relatively new to Houston, so take this statement with a grain of salt, but this is the best coffee shop I have been to in Houston so far. The seating area is small, but it felt very intimate and calming. The service was great and the staff are welcoming. Overall, I am putting this place as a 4.1/5 and think it’s a great place for a date or just some good coffee!', 'I love this spot for sports and casual social nights but the coffee spot is the best for WFH! There is enough plugs by the tables, music isn’t too loud and staff is very friendly. I ordered a dirty chai latte with brown sugar syrup ⭐️ highly recommend!\nThey also have a morning cocktail menu that looked really good.', 'BHBG Coffee, located inside Bayou Heights Bier Garten, is a hidden gem. The interior is cozy and welcoming—perfect for studying or working in peace. However, if you’re planning to chat with friends, I’d recommend the outdoor covered seating instead.\n\nTheir iced Matcha coffee and iced Dirty Chai are fantastic, both packed with flavor.

I definitely recommend!', 'I’ve been on a huge pistachio kick as of late and when my friend recommended me to try a pistachio latte here, I was sold. I came here during the day time and while the parking lot is big, it was quite busy! The inside was incredibly spacious and clean, making it a good place to chat with friends or do some work. I ordered my pistachio latte with soy milk and the price was quite steep… the total came out to be $9. However, my drink was as good as I expected it to be. The espresso was of great quality… very smooth and blended in perfectly with the soy milk. Once I mixed the pistachio cream/paste into the drink, my mind was blown by the flavor. Very realistic and fresh tasting nuttiness that paired perfectly with the latte. Not too sweet either which I highly appreciate. Despite the high price I was absolutely satisfied with my drink and I find myself craving another one already! Shout out to this place for supporting my pistachio craze!', 'Great atmosphere and a very good menu. The pastries were really good, too. Not a big fan of their samosa, but it depends on your taste.

The lady at the counter was really helpful and professional.', 'This is probably one of my new favorite coffee shops!! ☕️ the store is so cute and clean. They have plenty of comfortable seating and outlets for working. They also have a pretty big patio. They have a unique variety of options. The turkish coffee and pistachio latte were so good!! And the ladies are super nice. We will definitely be back, 10/10 recommend!!', ""I recently visited Qamaria Cafe and tried a few of their popular items. Here's my honest review:\n\n- Honeycomb Bread: This was my first time trying honeycomb bread, and while it was interesting, I found it overpowering due to the excessive honey. The butter filling inside was delicious, though!\n- Kunafa Dubai Viral Chocolate: Although it was a unique and tasty experience, I felt it was overpriced for the small portion size.\n- Cardamom Coffee: Unfortunately, this was a major letdown. The coffee was incredibly bitter and had a strange, unpleasant taste, reminiscent of leftover coffee at the bottom of the pot. It was undrinkable.\n\nOverall, my experience at Qamaria Cafe was mixed. While some items showed promise, others fell short. Perhaps they can work on balancing flavors.""]"
Bohemeo's,4.6,896,"['This place is by far my favorite coffee shop, and a integral part of Houston culture for many years.

I highly recommend this spot to anyone and everyone 👍 11/10 will be back always.', 'Outstanding!  This is a casual neighborhood coffee/bar/cafe.  The espresso is excellent.  The Baja Fish Tacos are freshly made and delicious on the whole wheat tortillas.  You can sit inside or outside on the patio or in the garden area.  I sat in the covered patio with cooling fans for a pleasant afternoon lunch.  The name is perfect.  The place is truly Bohemian!  I have to come back in the evening when the bands play.  Great for coffee or a beer.\n\nUpdate:  this place is consistently great.  I have watched several musicians play in the evenings.  It is just a fine place to hang out.', 'What a diamond!

It was almost full when we arrived at around 10:30am on a Sunday morning.  My friend ordered matcha latte and I ordered French Press.  She liked the latte.  I have never tried French Press, and understand from the staff that it's a black coffee with stronger flavor.  I decided to try it out of curiosity. It's relatively good, and it's served in a jug that's enough to be shared by two people.  But I guess I would prefer more creamy coffee, so next time I will probably stick to cappuccino.  The atmosphere is very pleasant, the cafe is well lighted with natural light.  I would recommend it to those who want to gather with a friend for a chat, or just some quiet time alone over a coffee.  It's conveniently located near energy corridor, with a lot of parking space. The price is reasonable."", 'Coffee is super milky, doesn’t taste too much like coffee. Lots of parking and good area.

The ambience is truly lovely, featuring spacious seating and a beautiful color scheme that makes it a perfect spot for working or relaxing. However, my last couple of visits have been quite disappointing.\n\nUnfortunately, the service has not been up to par lately.

The customer engagement has been minimal, which is frustrating, especially when I often go to coffee shops to work.\n\nOn one occasion, I wasn’t satisfied with the drink I ordered and asked for a different drink. Instead of a quick fix, it felt like I was asking for a major favor. When I brought my concerns to the barista, it felt like accommodating me was a hassle.

She was very sweet and attentive to our table. Overall a decent coffee and dining experience. Will definitely return to try more coffee forward drinks.', ""I stopped by here on a work break and was not disappointed. The coffee was great, and they had a couple of unique specialty drinks using local ingredients. I got the truffle latte, but will be back to try the port latte for sure. They had a good variety of food available as well, which was a pleasant surprise.  The atmosphere was bustling but also serene, which is what I'm looking for in a coffee shop.

Price range was higher than expected and I didn't think it matched the quality/taste.

Great people working there--very kind and courteous. I was there an hour or more, and it was non-stop lofi hip hop (which I love), but many songs had frequent profanity (which I don't love)."", ""During a stopover in Phoenix, I stopped at Case Study for the good reviews on coffee and space to work. I may have caught an off day or off moment, but was quite disappointed in the experience. My drink, which was 7 dollars, was not even a full cup, mostly ice, and mediocre. The service also seemed focused on other guests, so while they were polite they were much more into helping other customers and I felt ceremoniously shuffled through.

Dark Hall Coffee,4.6,549,"[""We LOVED this moody little coffee shop! Totally our aesthetics and vibe. The pastries are top notch, made from scratch and just flat out delicious. We had two holiday specials, their version of a Pumpkin Spice Latte and Sweet Potato Latte. These were very tasty and had distinctive flavor profiles that set it apart from a commercial mainstream coffee house. This is a MUST when in the Phoenix area. Note: pastries do sell out, so get there early for best selection. They also neighbor a cafe that has some incredible savory food options if you are one of those that don't want sweet things with their coffee."", ""I love coming in to see all the new and creative pastries. The drinks are great and definitely a boost to my day. The place is very calming and very quiet but not in a bad way. There is seating everywhere, and it's inside or outside.

I love to come here alone to work, enjoy some time out of the house, or meet with friends.

To drink I either get a dirty chai iced tea or the matcha iced tea with lavender and they are both amazing, my friend loves the matcha w lavender also and the americano! The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is fantastic. When it's not too hot out the patio out back is lovely and a great place to hang out."", 'The interior of the place is dark as black coffee. The skeletal wall art, venomous viper door handle, and sus (to me) pentagram at the front counter gave off a sort of “sipping coffee with Satan” vibe.\n\nThe display case was fat with delicious  baked treats so I grabbed a chunk of cinnamon-sugar crumb coffee cake with a cup of house blend coffee.\n\nWhen the barista pointed out the creepy-cute cinnamon skull baked into my cake, I didn’t know if I was supposed to eat it or hang it up as skull wall art.\n\nSo I just took it to my table and admired it a bunch.

Luckily I was able to find a small table out of the way to wait for my order. I got lucky because soon after ordering the line of people got even longer. They had a sign up with some seasonal drinks so I decided to go away from my usual drink and ordered a snickerdoodle latte as well as a breakfast bagel in a everything bagel with ham, egg and cheese. Service was friendly and patient with my few questions. The location was clean and lots of seating inside and out. They even have a rentable office space. My latte was delicious and has the perfect sweetness. My bagel was tasty. Great stop.', 'This review is for the in store printer.\n\nFirst you email your document to a print service and they give you a code and charge credit then you have to enter code to print but the machine will not print because it is out of paper. Why is it out of paper ? Because customers at elevate coffee who are sitting there with their laptops take paper freely from the printer as scratch paper. So that when people who actually want to print there will have no paper. The audacity of some of these people who sit on tables dedicated to the printer and use the power supply. So customers who want to actually print don’t even have a place to sit and have to stand. When you ask the coffee shop employees they have no paper. In the end you are charged a credit but your documents are not printed.', 'Elevate made my morning!! The girl who took my order was so kind and welcoming. My coffee is perfection & to top it off, gluten free delicious pesto crepes 🥹 this is a new a tradition when I stop thru PHX.']"
William's Coffee Co,4.6,328,"['This place is an absolute hidden gem that more people need to know about.  The amount of attention to detail and care of each ingredient is just unlike any other coffee/pastry shop. No artificial anything, everything is made fresh in house.  They make their own syrups, even the way they get their beans and sugar are all highly scrutinized and selected.  This is a place that may be out of the way but it’s completely worth taking the extra few minutes to get to.', 'Cute place\nWe arrived at 6:20 and the gentleman allowed us to walk in 5 mins early.\nAlthough there would be no pastries or food available.\nWe both ordered caramel macchiato with oat milk, the coffee was perfectly strong but there lacked a bit of sweetness.', 'I love this place!

There was a very large group of people set up outside on tables. After waiting to break through the large number of people rudely congregating in front of the entrance we ordered our coffee. I asked about the large group of people and was told it was a democrat group that gathers there every month. That explains the entitled behavior of people blocking the front door, zero consideration for other people, unless of course you live an alternative lifestyle or are here illegally. We waited 45 minutes for our coffee. The coffee was great and the young lady helping us was great. I suggest you explain to the incredibly rude group that gathers at your store to not block the only way to enter your store. I had to ask three times for them to move so I could walk to my car.', 'I wish I would have taken a picture of the food before I devoured it!

I personally don’t like espresso and it’s unfortunate that they don’t have cold brew or matcha, but that is just my preference. Their iced coffee is hot drip with espresso shots all poured over ice. Coming from a former barista, that is not iced coffee. The worst part of coming here is that I have seen a different barista every time and they all seem like they hate their job and that me ordering is an inconvenience to them. I have never had such a consistently bad experience at a coffee shop in Phoenix. I will say their pastries are pretty good, but it does not make up for their lack of service or lack of coffee craft.']"

Caffe Vita Coffee Roasting,4.7,87,"['Thought this place was cool, until I saw just how much they are unsanitary. Early 7AM morning, pretty empty other than 3 guests who by the sound and look of it- seemed like regulars.

That individual left before I did and I waited to observe the employee follow up to sanitize the table and chair. Not to my surprise , the area was not tended to. As I exited the building, the door frame has a felt seal around it and I could believe how much dog/pet hair is caught on it. Especially with air flow each time the door opens or with each dog that walks in. So disappointed at the lack of common courtesy. I understand being pet friendly to an extent, but this is overdoing it. Extremely unsanitary. The last thing I want is dog hair in my coffee cup or on my food.  Beware.', 'The manager was welcoming and took preferences into account for his recommendations. We got 2 mochas. I preferred the campfire mocha, which had a darker, richer chocolate taste. The other had a lighter milk chocolate taste, similar to a foam. Both had some bitterness. The blended version increases the sweetness to a level similar to a chocolate milk. I could definitely go back to try an iced version.\n\nThe atmosphere is lovely. They had plenty of seating with tables. We grabbed the couch but most are simple, modern chairs.

The Human Bean,4.5,451,"['I was actually pleasantly surprised at this place. Although,  I normally am a very loyal ""Dutch Brothers "" fan. Go there daily. Often more than once a day! 🙄 I thought that I would check this place out.  And glad that I did!!!  The coffee was great!!  Service was actually even better!! They give you a ""covered "" coffee bean with each order as well!! (Not sure WHAT it is coated in) given it was whit(ish) speckled kind of.  Not dark like milk or dark chocolate.  It was very good though!!👍  I will definitely be visiting again in the very near future!! 👌', 'Used to love this location, things have changed. Long wait times, and quality of drinks seems like its affected as well. The app update is also not the best. Love the location, hope things improve, baristas as the best, super sweet!\n\nSide note: Maybe better signs that there is now an intercom vs driving all the way around the way the drive thru has always been, just a tip.', 'Waited in line for 15 mins only to get to the window and be told they won’t take my order at the window. I’ve been here many times, including two days ago and no one told me anything when I ordered at the window then. The employee at the window wasn’t rude just refused to take my order and insisted I had to go use the speaker box and get to the back for the line and wait another 15 mins.', ""We've been going there since it opened. Coffee drinks are great, but they also, hands down, have the best iced tea!  It's not watered down and we really appreciate that (unlike other establishments). The staff is happy and the chocolate covered beans that you get for free are always a big treat!  I highly recommend!"", 'This location has added a drive up order box in the front of the building. It is very difficult to get to the speaker when turning in off 16th St. You have to drive all the way around the building AND there is really no indication that you need to do this. Every time I go to this location someone drives in and directly to the pick up window while I am busy driving around to the speaker box. Invariably the barista takes that person’s order right at the window! So my wait is extra long. The only thing management has done is post a small hand written cardboard sign that is not noticeable unless you are at the pick up window advising people that orders will only be taken through the speaker menu. Clearly this is not true. Perhaps management could invest in some plastic rope chains and place them along the drive through route-thereby signaling people coming in from 16th St that they can not just drive directly to the window? Dutch Brothers seems to manage this just fine. In the meantime I avoid going to the Human Bean because I just don’t need extra stress and aggravation.']"

The strawberry milk is poured first in the cup then the vibrant green matcha is poured on top. Oh my, the freshness, the consistency, the taste of the matcha MIXED with a nice strawberry milk is a chef kiss. Now I’ve been on a mini series of finding the best strawberry matcha iced latte in Philly and I can conclude that this cafe wins! Not only do they have my favorite drink but others as well.

Execution is perfect every time. Roast and brew yields an espresso that is complex and surprising across each sip. The only knock on this excellent experience is, unsurprisingly, the cafe can become noisy and packed with other customers in ways that can make for a busy and quick visit. Having been here in busy times and quiet times, this is fault of success rather than design or neglect.

It came out to be $7.56 with tax. That’s kind of expensive but not really because of the “POWER.” When a smoothie has protein, it costs upwards of $6.\n\nI left the store and took a sip, but came right back because I didn’t taste any power. It was watery, actually.\n\nI asked the person for the ingredients and he said, spinach, pineapple, apple, and banana. I asked, “Well where’s the power?” He said, “Maybe the spinach.”\n\nOverall, I’m tired of businesses doing stuff like this. Without protein, unless you’re price gouging your patrons, no one should ever spend $7 for a power smoothie that does not have protein.\n\nNeedless to say, I won’t be back because I cannot pad the pockets of price gougers. I don’t care how much things cost if you are selling me what you say it is.\n\nPower does not come from spinach in smoothies. When talking about smoothies, power is protein.

I prefer light to medium roast so that my palate can pick up flavor profiles. I only drink black coffee for that reason. Having managed a popular coffee shop, I became well versed with the process of this essential ritual! From farm to cup…the best way to appreciate the process is in tasting the notes and the pride from their origins. The coffee is dark roasted, served extremely hot and I couldn’t drink it for awhile. When the temperature was finally drinkable, I just couldn’t drink it. Again, it’s preference. I was seating next to a couple and the gentleman kept saying he loves this place & their coffee. I would also loved to enjoy a nice mug instead of a to go cup while enjoying the space. They don’t use “to stay” cups. The croissant, although warned didn’t taste fresh.\nWill I recommend?

It was good but again, nothing special.\n\nThe atmosphere is quaint and it has a larger upstairs section with good seating so don't be fooled by the small lower section. I wish it was slightly cleaner, but that's getting into nitpicking territory.\n\nI'd definitely rate this place a hard 4-4.5, nothing I'd go out of my way to go back to, but if I'm in the area and peckish or had some time to kill I'd definitely stop by.

Not only do they offer delicious coffee, but they also have some amazing avocado toast options. The best part is, you can conveniently order right from your phone for quick service. When you visit, I highly recommend trying their unique beet latte. It's a surprisingly delightful twist on a classic latte. As for the avocado toast, I suggest going for the one topped with scrambled eggs and a flavorful chili spread. Trust me, it's a winning combination that will leave you wanting more. Enjoy!"", 'Went here with 4 of my guys from my tennis team, just came in for coffee.

I was very happy to be a patron at the establishment for its first week open. I had no problem buying the merchandise and the pod coffee! I will wear the merchandise proudly.  However, I think pricing is not commensurate with the size that you get, especially today's times when people are looking for value for their dollar. People are giving you their disposable income for your product. I may go back in if I happen to be in the area, but I don't know. The calling out of the customer's orders needs to be more efficient. When you're crowded, the call out for the customer's name and needs to be very loud for people to hear it in the back of the store. You had way too many drinks sitting on the counter with no customers names, and very friendly but very busy employees were doing their best to get the orders out.

Then to go, we ordered my BIL an Iced Americano.\n\nService:\nWhen we ordered, we got to chat with one of the barista's for a bit, asking about their history. She was very friendly and knowledgable. When we picked up the drinks, we were able to ask a little bit about their merch, and ended up buying a hat and a shirt from them.\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe vibe is definitely a younger crowd - young adults, college-aged, UTSA students. But very welcoming. Like I mentioned before, it carries a club culture to it, and not in an exclusive way. It makes you feel like you belong and are a part of their little tribe. Great place to sit and chat, or to work and study. Limited seating inside; however, if it wasn't so windy, we would've sat outside.\n\nOverall, we really loved our experience at Indy Coffee Club.

You walk in and you feel the warmth of the place immediately. The barista was friendly and embraced my coffee complaints to help guide my selection of drink. I complained I always get warm milk and so he guided me to the Das Machine, which is a double shot of espresso with agave to sweeten and balance the bitter notes of your typical espresso. My wife chose a cappuccino, which isn't all foam like in most places. It was well balanced and just the right amount of sweet. For a light breakfast we got a Quesito, a mix between a cheese danish and a pan dulce.\n\nSo...the drinks...wonderful...and most importantly they tasted like coffee. Their triple basket Aussie menu is coffee forward and the mixology is able to provide full dark roast flavor while cutting the bitterness and NOT just serving you warm milk with no real coffee flavor.\n\nThe pastry...it's good. Probably could have been toasted a little more.\n\nIf we lived here...I would definitely work in the co-op area. Oh, and the back area...very cozy and comfy.\n\nLastly...the service. Jackson, our barista, was extremely helpful with drink suggestions and a wealth of knowledge about different roasts and techniques to brew our espresso at home. We will definitely be back next time we're in town.""]"

I was blown away !! Devin with his amazing customer service as soon as we walked and Megan with her skill of crafting the hands down best Iced Chai latte I have ever had!! Mind you I’ve traveled all\nOver and have had chai from many places !! This by sat was the best my boyfriend had the espresso he is an espresso man and said it was a great espresso!! You get a little water with your espresso to wash down which is great at a coffee house. The warm chocolate chip sea salt cookie was a perfect combination!! Will absolutely come back !!', 'I\'m a black coffee kind of guy. I\'m frickin beast, I know. I split my black coffee consumption into 3 major groups: normal black coffee, americanos, and cold brews. Sometimes I want my black coffees and americanos hot, sometimes iced. Depends on the weather. Cold brew always iced, obviously.\n\nWhen we came to Local Coffee Founders under the scorching San Antonio sun, I asked for an iced coffee which was $3.25. She rang me up for $4.50. I looked at the menu hanging above her and said ""it says it\'s $3.25 for a coffee...""\n\nI thought an iced coffee was just a hot coffee, poured on ice. That\'s it. That\'s all I wanted. It\'s what I do at home. Not rocket science.\n\nShe seemed baffled and responded ""you said you wanted a cold brew?"" I said ""I asked for an iced coffee..."" She looked at me crazy and said ""that\'s the same thing...""\n\nI just kind of stared off in the distance, trying to process this. She filled the silence with ""...if you want a normal coffee it comes hot""\n\nShe also seemed genuinely confused, so I was trying to be nice and said ""If I just wanted that hot coffee, on ice..."" ""We don\'t do that."" Uhmmmmmm, ok?\n\nI was going to order a hot coffee with a cup of ice on the side just for the plot, but the tension was mounting and I got really shy so I just said ""a cold brew is fine.""\n\nThe cold brew was admittedly GAS, but I was still ready to go scorched earth on this review. Then a funny thing happened: This morning at a coffee shop in NY, the same situation occurred. The barista again was looking at me like I had 3 heads. The evidence was mounting, it must be a me problem.\n\nI took to google and typed in ""What is an iced coffee reddit"" and have become more confused than ever. It\'s not as straightforward as I thought. I\'m deep on r/barista right now, and there seems to be a lot of contention over this issue.\n\nThe baristas of reddit, the most accurate source for anything, are saying there is no clear answer for what is an ""iced coffee."" Some customers expect a ""flashbrew"" which is essentially what I was asking for, some expect a cold brew, some expect a black coffee with a little sweetener, and a few psychos expect a latte.\n\nI still feel like an iced coffee should be just a black coffee over ice, but what do I know? People are different, and I feel for baristas when customers expect them to read their mind. I will just have to ask for a coffee with a cup of ice on the side moving forward.\n\nAlso, I know this doesn\'t tie in but there was a dude working out of here with 3 screens set up. A full battle station. Ridiculous. Bro better start paying rent and utilities at that point smh.\n\nI\'m ending this review with more questions than I started with, but that\'s life sometimes. Can I no longer get a regular iced coffee? Is this not a thing people do anymore? Finding the right questions to ask is often more important than answers...\n\nIG @jnov_\nTiktok @jnov_reviews', 'I went in to co-work for the first time and was excited to give it a try. Unfortunately it was pretty busy (1:00 pm) and all of the tables were taken. It took me a minute to find a single stool at the bar against the window in the back.\n\nThe ledge against the window was pretty thin and it was hard to set up my computer comfortably to work from. The screen was at a weird angle and I ended up having to pull it forward so that it was off the ledge a bit to be able to work comfortably. That kind of stressed me out because the walkway behind me was pretty narrow. So every time someone passed by I had to move forward and I nudged the computer. There were also a lot of flies nearby so 5 minutes into sitting there, I was ready to go.\n\nI got my usual, a chai latte, but on the first sip I noticed it was nothing but a black tea with milk. There was no hint of the traditional herbs and spices you would come to expect from a chai latte. You could see them in the lid and at the bottom of the drink but you could not taste them; even after swirling and stirring. I drank about half of it before I tossed it and ended up going to a different spot.']"

Asked a few questions about the menu and didn’t get much help.

Girl at the window didn’t crack a smile at any point, hardly said any words. My fiance said if the service was better, it would’ve been 10/10 because the coffee was pretty good.

Been going here since they first opened, and love having it with my weekend breakfast! Pictured are fall drinks with pumpkin, but they have so many other options to choose from.

Told me she would talk to the staff which by the way I will say has completely changed since when I first started going there I know they’re trying to sell the business so it’s I don’t care type of situation or what but it’s just going downhill the atmosphere isn’t where it was at And the quality is just nonexistent at this time I mean, how are you not gonna ensure the safety of your customers and then when they bring it to your attention kind of shrug it off as if it’s no big deal like I buy drinks for my children here there’s no excuses to have a nail from your ice bag in the bottom of my drink  at this point, I think that was Cajun coffee shop unfortunately .', 'It’s been a while since I been back here I like it because of the sugar free options but I don’t like the vibe anymore the girls are incredibly rude like they don’t care to be at work they really just need to be fired so they can hire happier people and I don’t want owners to comment back saying oh I’m sorry for your experience if there not going to do anything about it', 'Shout out to the new owners!

Employees were very kind and patient despite crowd.', 'Only the drive through was open but that didn’t take away from how amazing my latte was! I had the lady pick something out for me and we ended up with the vanilla lavender latte. I have had a lot of coffee beverages with lavender, but this is BY FAR the best one I’ve had!!! I had my daughter with me and wanted to get her something with the rainbow foam, so they were able to make a hot chocolate with the rainbow foam for her. She loved it so much!

We got the goat cheese and mushroom empanada, which was very good flavor and the beef, being told that it was a very popular one, which kinda missed the mark.

Some coffee beans and the merchants are sold here. I would say their food is great like croissants, bruitto and especially the empanadas. I could say having never seen the empanadas in breakfast stop in the area. The beef, chicken, ham and cheese are popular. They are kept in an oven to ensure they are hot and crispy empanadas.

Since things were working out so well between us, we decided to take our relationship to the next level and order the “Breakfast Burrito 🌯“. But man, some relationships are meant to stay the way they were. It was missing cheese, bacon and hash browns were a bit burnt, and it was missing flavor (maybe it was a healthy version of a burrito? 😄). For now, I won’t change my rating as I rate them for coffee but do yourself a favor and skip the burrito.\n\nYou’re good the way you are with just your coffee 🫶🏽']"

James Coffee Co.,4.6,272,"['James Coffee is the best coffee in town. I am a coffee lover and coffee snob. I wear my Italian coffee drinking days with honor. James is the best.

If you’re like me and like a good mocha, the flavors of the flavored latte are perfectly mixed throughout every sip.\n\nTheir use of quality ingredients (the right oat or almond milk for me), their knowledge of the right measured espresso shot, and how they take their time (without waiting too long) making the coffee is what makes this place so special.\n\nThe staff is very good at what they do, and they know it. They don’t rush making your drink to ensure quality, yet they subscribe to the American desire for urgent gratification of reasonably fast service. Coffee takes an average of 5-10 mins to be ready.\n\nBut what I love about this place and the people who go there is this understanding that if you come to James, you’re going to get good coffee, and you’re going to enjoy it. It’s one of the few places in town that allows you to slow down a bit, and watch the poodles walk by as you sip on your James Coffee of choice.', 'Atmosphere was good at 7 am with busy workers and chill tunes playing in the background.

We typically take our dog for a walk at Mission Bay in the morning and then grab our coffees (vanilla almond milk latte and vanilla latte with regular milk) and our croissant sandwiches with bacon/ham egg and cheese. They get their croissants from a local bakery, and it is always fresh and perfectly flaky. Service is always 6/5. The baristas always seem to be so happy there, and they make everyone feel like a regular. That’s when you know when a coffee shop doesn’t feel like a regular coffee shop - it feels cozy, familiar…and the added bonus..great coffee! They are also family-friendly and dog-friendly (they always ask if your dog wants a treat).

It’s the best deal in town.', 'It pains me to write a negative review about Caffe Calabria, but I unfortunately had a terrible experience at a spot that has long been one of my favorite coffee shops/pizza spots in the neighborhood. While the food and beverages are still really great, a man who (I think) was the owner was incredibly rude during my visit there today.\n\nSince I moved to San Diego in 2005, I have visited Caffe Calabria countless times. Sometimes, it was just to pick up a cup of coffee during a weekend walk, other times it was to work/study while eating lunch, cookies and lattes, or to stop in for pizza and cocktails. On one occasion, I reserved the back patio for a group for dinner and drinks for a nonprofit I volunteer for.\n\nUntil today, service from the staff has always been kind and efficient, and it\'s been a place I frequent on at least a weekly basis (sometime more frequently if I was really craving a bicerin).\n\nCut to this afternoon, when I was there on a very slow Monday around lunchtime. I was there to eat lunch, meet a friend and to do some writing around 11 a.m., but after ordering and sitting down, I realized my laptop was starting to die. I looked around for a plug and didn\'t find one near me, so I moved to one of the only three tables that did have one under them. I did see that they had signs saying the tables were for eating only and no computers or crafts could be done at those tables (other tables said no computers after 3 p.m.), but since more than half the tables were empty and I had just bought a sandwich and two coffees for myself, I thought it would be OK to sit there while my laptop charged for a bit while waiting for my friend to arrive.\n\nThen the owner came over and rudely reiterated the rule to me. He kept saying ""it\'s fine today because we\'re slow, but for future reference, we don\'t allow computers at these three tables."" I tried to apologize as I explained my situation, but he kept being very rude toward me, adding that computers were banned at the only tables that have plugs ""by design"" because he doesn\'t want people working on computers in his cafe.\n\nI understand having rules, and explaining these rules if you\'re busy and need to turn tables, but it\'s quite another thing to berate someone about it. I am not sure when it changed from being a welcoming place, but this lack of decency was unacceptable. I\'ll miss the pizza and coffee, but unfortunately the way he treated me means I won\'t be back.', 'My private practice is literally a few doors away… and I love coming here after work.

They don't have to offer restrooms all the time at all hours as they generously do but I'm pointing out you can't reliably count on using their restrooms anytime you show up even if they're 24 hours.

We tried the horchata iced latte, which was hands down the best latte I’ve ever had. The flavors were on point, perfectly balanced between creamy and refreshing. We also got a charcoal vanilla latte, which had a unique twist and was equally impressive.\n\nThe staff was incredibly friendly, and the vibe of the place is unmatched. They’ve got a sick vinyl collection with a listening station, and the music they had playing just added to the experience. They have niche artwork, with some awesome pieces featuring the bars from the Beastie Boys, which just adds to the cool factor. Honestly, Starbucks has nothing on these guys.

To start, Communal Coffee roasts their own beans! The flavor is a magic combination of earthy, rich and smooth, and Communal delivers their magic consistently and at a high quality.\n\nWhat brings me back to Communal Coffee time and time again is the warmth and unremitting smiles of their exceptional team. Lily, Bea, and their team make me feel truly welcome and at home at Communal.\n\nCommunal Coffee is the first place I take visiting friends (Does anything say San Diego more than delicious coffee outside in a sun speckled courtyard in the month of March?!), and the first place I venture too each morning with my dog.

The atmosphere here can be nice but was crowded and noisy with many business professionals standing and talking thoroughout certain parts of the morning. Additionally, there was a fire drill while there that also took away from the experience.

I stood in front of her as she filled one tray with muffins, adjusted a sign, reached behind her to get the next bin of muffins, grab the next tray and begin filling before she asked how she could help me.

When my order was ready, they brought a closed box to the table, which for me translates to: 'Here’s your order, take it away.' When I asked the barista if they had utensils, he replied no.

My wife and two children had to wait 15 minutes before any waiter even acknowledged us.\n\nWhile this is my personal account, I’ll stick to the facts. Several waiters passed by our table, offering variations of “I’ll be right with you,” “Just a minute,” or “I’ll be right back.” After hearing this repeatedly, I asked my wife, “How many times are they going to say that without even taking our drink order?”\n\nTo make matters worse, we were sitting at the very first table as soon as you walk in, so it wasn’t as though we were hidden in a corner. The heat inside the restaurant was also unbearable, making the wait even more uncomfortable.\n\nNow, the food itself was good—flavorful, even—but the portion sizes left something to be desired. Despite the quality of the food, I chose not to tip the waiter because the service was simply unacceptable. We felt neglected throughout the entire meal.\n\nAs we were leaving, another couple walked in and sat at an open table, only to be told by a waitress that they couldn’t be seated because the cooks were going on their lunch break. When the couple asked how long the break would be, the waitress just shrugged and said she didn’t know. The couple handled it graciously, saying they would come back another day, but this bizarre exchange seemed like the final straw in a string of poor service moments.\n\nI understand that restaurants can be busy, but as paying customers, we expect to be treated with a certain level of care and attentiveness.\n\nGood service is the foundation of any successful business. Unfortunately, this experience left my family and me feeling like an afterthought. We won’t be returning.']"

It felt like a place worth exploring, and I decided to try two of their coffee offerings. The first was the Philtered Soul, a coffee that I found particularly appealing because it wasn't overly sweet. I appreciate a coffee that retains its rich coffee flavor without excessive sweetness, and the Philtered Soul delivered on that front.\n\nThe second drink I sampled was the Iced Coffee Rose, which, while good, leaned slightly towards sweetness. However, I've always believed that a coffee should maintain its true coffee essence, and I wouldn't classify it as such if it's overly sweet.\n\nIn summary, my experience at Phil's Coffee was quite enjoyable. The Philtered Soul, in particular, left a lasting impression with its amazing flavor profile, while the Iced Coffee Rose was a good choice, even if it was slightly sweeter than my preference.

The menu was not what I was expecting, in a good way!

I was easily able to customize the drink to have less ice (maybe regular ice would have helped with the sweetness haha) and to be made with 2% milk. I also bought the veggie quiche for myself; the staff heated it up without my needing to ask and it was honestly the tastiest, most well-textured quiche I’ve ever had!

K Cafe Patisserie & Tea House,3.9,729,"[""I recently visited this charming coffee shop, and it quickly became one of my favorite spots. We ordered a Hazelnut Latte and a Caramel Latte, and both were exceptionally delicious. The flavors were well-balanced, offering just the right amount of sweetness without overpowering the coffee. It’s clear that they use high-quality ingredients and put thought into crafting each drink. Every sip was smooth and flavorful, making it a delightful treat.\nThe environment of the coffee shop was another highlight of the experience. The ambiance was calming and romantic, perfect for a relaxing morning or a peaceful afternoon. It felt cozy yet spacious, offering a great blend of warmth and comfort. It’s an ideal spot whether you’re looking for a quiet corner to read or a cozy place to chat with friends.\nThe shop also offers a wide variety of breakfast and brunch options, which is perfect for those looking to enjoy more than just coffee. Whether you're stopping by for a quick snack or a leisurely meal, the menu has something for everyone. I was impressed by the variety and look forward to trying more of their offerings during my next visit.\nOne of the most unique aspects of the place is its design. The shop is filled with plants and greenery, giving it a greenhouse-like feel. It’s a refreshing change from typical coffee shop decor and adds a natural, vibrant energy to the space. The ceiling, both inside and outside, is beautifully decorative, adding to the overall charm of the shop. It’s clear that a lot of thought and creativity went into designing the space, and it really makes the place stand out.\nOn top of that, everything was extremely clean. The tables were spotless, and the restroom was one of the cleanest I’ve seen in any cafe. It's clear the staff takes pride in maintaining a welcoming and hygienic environment for their customers.\nOverall, this coffee shop is a gem. From the delicious drinks to the beautifully designed space, it offers a fantastic experience. I highly recommend stopping by if you're looking for great coffee in a cozy, inviting setting."", 'Cute cafe with girly vibes and decor.\nFood was alright, it does have a fusion side to it with many of the dishes having an Asian twist.\n\nOn the weekend, there is always a line.

It was very busy so I'll only -1 star."", ""K Cafe is a great effort, but somewhat of a disappointment and I fear it may be due to reasons outside of the establishment's control--but the experience is mid nonetheless.  I have been here three times, only because all of those three times I was not the one to purchase anything myself.  Initial impressions are that the cafe is cute and Instagrammable, probably to the liking of people who like to be cute and follow online trends.  This first impression was the only decent thing about the whole experience.  Otherwise, the cafe tends to be flooded with customers, leaving the cramped room overbearing and congested.  The service is ok.  All of the staff are extremely kind and do their best, but any administration or supervision is just lacking--there could be more guidance among the staff or a better way to deal with a lot of hassle that tends to happen either among customers or with staff confusion.  My final critique is on the food, which is the one good that is charged here.  For a place whose selling point is the aesthetic, that is exactly what you pay for.  The food itself is not at all worth the price--$18 for a dish that can be recreated at home for less than a quarter of the price is ridiculous.  Absolutely do not come out here if you're looking for an actual, good meal.  The good is greasy, sparse, rushed and cheap.  Drinks the same.  The hollandaise was broken.  The cakes are dry.  Of course, everything is edible, but really not worth its price.  I could only recommend K Cafe as a place to try once for anyone who wants to be somewhere that feels somewhat magical and isn't too critical of cuteness and capitalism ;P\nBut yeah the staff is mega sweet and does their best (so it's understandable that they're mega tired mid shift because of how busy the place is, not to mention how long people stay bc they also paid a fat amount and also the aesthetics etc.)""]"

The food always come really fast, really save a lot of my time!', ""Joyheart Cafe is a terrific Taiwanese vegan / vegetarian spot. We got the braised tofu with rice, vegetarian eel with rice, and a pot of Assam tea. Everything was fantastic - healthy, flavorful, not too much spice, and super delicious. The ambience and service was solid too, a great spot for lunch. It's a shame they're not open for dinner. Check out the grocery store inside as well, lots of goodies."", 'My mom and I came here for their vegetarian menu since she does eat meat, chives, onion, and garlic. The place is in the back of the plaza when you first turn in off the road; I wish there were signs, but we found it by driving around, whew. There’s a good amount of parking.\n\nThe inside is half grocery store and half cafe. We walked around to check out the items then asked to get seated. I got the rainbow noodles — noodles topped with vegetarian “minced pork”, purple cabbage, carrots, egg, and cucumber. The flavor was so good! Mom for the vegetarian braised “eel” pot rice. The rice was a bit too soft and wet and the dish could have used more flavor. The braised fake eel was a mind trip! It looks pretty real and the texture is great. I’ll be back for more. The meals aren’t too pricey either at $~12 for the individual entrees.']"
"Jiaren Cafe: Coffee, Boba & Events",4.6,385,"[""Jiaren Cafe is a cheery spot for a variety of coffee, tea, and other drinks. I've sampled a few and have been generally satisfied. The Mocha and Dirty Ube Latte were well-made, and I was refreshed by the Strawberry Black Milk Tea. The more unique drinks have been hit-or-miss though. For example, I was a bit disappointed by the Yin Yang Coffee Milk Tea, as it was a bit under-sweetened (even at 100%) and the flavors were a bit confounding. I'm also unsure if activated charcoal is anything more than a fad.\n\nAs far as other aspects, Jiaren Cafe is pretty good too. The staff are friendly & welcoming, and I've enjoyed sitting down and getting some work done. Maybe the interior could use a refresh. I also appreciate the classes, workshops, & other experiences they offer to the community, though I've not yet taken part.\n\nOverall, I think Jiaren Cafe is worth checking out, and I will probably return to try more items."", 'Absolutely adore this cozy coffee shop! It feels like a home away from home, with such positive vibes. The coffee and other drinks are simply divine, but the pecan cookies and their biscotti steal the show every time! Such a delightful treat to accompany their delicious beverages.\n\nPlus, they host a variety of cute workshops, adding an extra layer of charm and community to the experience. Highly recommend for anyone seeking a warm, inviting atmosphere, fantastic treats, and fun workshops to enjoy!', 'Cute and decorated cafe! They had variety of cold tea options. I had Rose and cheese tea- topped with boba and lychee jelly. It tasted delicious. Blueberry muffin was soft and less sweet.\nAmbience is nice. Service was great. Few seatings inside.', 'Jiaren Cafe is a cute hole in the wall cafe located behind their yoga center on the main road, so it’s easy to miss.\n\nI really enjoyed that they make every tea with care over the few times I have been there.\n\nI recommend the Strawberry Matcha that I customize with oat milk, unsweetened, and add lychee / strawberry jelly.\n\nThey are a little more expensive than other boba places, but I believe it’s worth it.', 'This place is incredibly interesting. The cafe, part of a yoga studio, has a very comfortable atmosphere and a super cute dining area. The coffee is tasty, and the pastries are fresh and delicious. I would recommend visiting this aromatic place.']"
ĂN VẶT CÔ BEO SAN JOSE,4.3,26,"[""Walk-ins welcome, for drive-by customers, I feel there's not enough parking for this unique coffee boba shop, or all parking spots have signs0 of other retail stores in the same plaza saying tow away if you are not their customer. A little harsh.\n\nI must place my order using the touch screen and pay with CC even when the barista is just standing and watching you.\n\nFood was good. Interior was beatiful and unique. I wish there's a warmer service."", 'Ooooh very charming cozy bubble tea shop in this Alma location. The downfall is the small limited parking space. The good thing we came here on a weekday. Four Stars for their pleasant, creative Interior Decorations and for the delightful creame brûlée and Macha milk tea!\nThere another Hair and Nail Salon connected to it on the other side. I would recommend coming here on weekends! Can’t imagine how crazy it would to find a parking spot🤣😬', 'Chill vibes remind of Saigon street food so much! The drinks are yummy, and you can get the best snacks to go!!', 'I brought a strawberry  milk shake and half of the ice was not smoshed.', 'Beautiful and small store. I recommend the ube brulee with flan and tapioca.']"
Peet's Coffee,4.4,295,"['Excellent coffee made here at Peet’s.  Been coming here for years and it’s a great place to meet a friend, sit outside and enjoy their delicious teas, coffees and their hot cocoa is fabulous. Very nice pastries, muffins and goodies here, too.  Extremely clean in here and the baristas are super kind and will make your drink exactly how you love it! A must stop shop for everything coffee!\nUpdate:  Yesterday, I purchased the Jubilant Blend, a special coffee made in honor of Black History Month.  It’s absolutely marvelous.  The most delicious coffee I have ever tasted; it’s so smooth, luscious and creamy.  A bountiful and beautiful blend.', 'Very friendly and sweet server. Interior is clean. I ordered a large Black ice tea with 7 pumps of Mango and lite ice (it came out fabulous)\nThere are about 10 tables on the inside and plenty of seating outside.\nOverall solid 4 stars.', 'This is a great gathering place. Of course excellent coffee and friendly baristas. It’s my go to coffee brand having a more robust flavor than Starbucks and way better than any other brand I’ve tried including organics water process decaf.  Peets is the only Coffee chain I’m aware of that only uses the chemical free water process for all their decaf coffee.\nPlenty of parking and outside seating.\nHighly recommended.', 'Overall experience was great, but this time, it was not so good.\nThe drip coffee i got tasted like super diluted. It is possible that due to high urgent demand, staff just took coffees out while it was still brewing, leaving the remaining coffee take like water.', 'They recently changed their hours so that they are only open until 8pm! This is pretty strange considering that it\'s summer, the movie theater in El Paseo is much busier now that the AMC theater in Vallco shut down, and it\'s not even dark at that time 🤔 I seriously think they\'re missing out on a lot of business.\n\nThey also put a code on the bathroom door, so maybe they were having problems with non-customers using the bathroom before? It\'s anyone\'s guess. All I know is that during the short time I was there, every single person they told the code to had troube opening the door because they just had to throw a special chatacter in at the end of a long string of numbers that no one could remember. 🤷\u200d♀️\n\nThey make good coffee and pastries/baked goods and their staff is knowledgeable and friendly. The strawberry ""pop tart"" had a nice pastry crust that appeared to have been brushed with egg white to give it that egg sheen. The filling tasted *exactly* like Smucker\'s strawberry jelly 🍓🤔... In fact, I think it might have been Smucker\'s strawberry jelly... Whether that\'s good or bad is up to you.\n\nOne thing that struck me as odd is that while they have a bunch of unusual ingredients to make strange concoctions, like tumeric and ginger for ""golden"" drinks, they have an extremely limited selection of more standard flavored syrups. No raspberry, no strawberry, no berry of any kind... Basically just chocolate, honey, and coconut...oh yeah, and tumeric 😦😬 🤢\n\nTheir ""golden"" drinks are really a Wintry flavor profile anyway (hence why they\'re not currently listed on the menu). They currently have NO SPECIALS (just said they can still make the tumeric stuff), NO fruit flavors, and an extremely LIMITED SELECTION of syrups. Come on, guys! Don\'t rest on your laurels. What are you doing to keep up with the competition?\n\nGet your tumeric latte before 8pm!']"
