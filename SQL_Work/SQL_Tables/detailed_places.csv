Came early on a Friday morning, one of their first customers. Their coffee was surprisingly really good! We ordered an americano and latte. My husband and I don’t drink coffee often but we loved it here. It came with pain au chocolate which were divine with our espressos. We also had the croque madame, good balance of meat, cheese and sunny side up egg but the toast underneath was a little dry. Still good nonetheless. Our waitress was so nice and sweet. Loved the atmosphere of this restaurant! Clean bathrooms.; Location top and staff amazing and super friendly! We had a brunch this morning and WOW! Food is super tasty ! We will definitely come back! Ps: un gracias especial a Federico, que ha sido súper simpático y habla un italiano perfecto! \
A big thanks to everyone.. we will definitely come back! Giulia & Sara from Italy ; Second visit, the first being brunch.\
Very friendly and the place was buzzing for dinner tonight. The host and staff were attentive and even helped with our struggles with french yet made us feel at ease. The menu was available online in English which was greatly appreciated. Food was excellent and the staff even went a little more than needed with service. I Enjoyed three courses and would happily eat here again.; Great place, amazing service, cute interior, very good food. We had the Eggs Benedict with Cheddar and Ham (€15) and it’s just like you’d wish them. They have full brunch menu for €25 with drinks included. There’s space for improvement for the Home Made Iced Tea, though. The taste is very faded, basically flavoured water and does not correspond to the price (€5). Still this place gets 5 stars from me for everything else.; Went on a Sunday morning for a buffet. It was excellent, pic below is part of what they offered, there was more ….The food was perfect from the eggs right down to the hot chocolate. 10/10, the price was worth the experience and quality of food and service.

It wasn't full when we arrived but after we sat down the place started to fill up with people. We ordered the crepe with ham, cheese and egg and the crepe little Breizh crepe as well as a cider. You can't have crepes without cider in France.\
The savoury ham, cheese and egg crepe was really crispy and savoury. I preferred the sweet crepe with ice cream and caramel more. It wasn't overly sweet. Everything went really well with the cider.\

The staff were super friendly and spoke fluent English.; I ordered a beef steak and was surprised when they brought a medium rare. By default in every restaurant I've ever been it's medium.\
\
Medium rare is still smth that I eat but it was unevenly fried and a half of the steak was completely raw. Although I was very hungry raw is not what I can eat.\
\
The waitress didn't even bother to ask why I didn't finish my steak. Overall she looked tired, unhappy and at the same time busy - she was the only one to serve all the tables. It wasn't a peak hour and only about third of the tables is not less were occupied.; Great place with great food. I had the sea bass and a huge portion of profiteroles for dessert. So good.\
The place is heaving with people in the evening, it’s got a very youthful vibe and I like that.\

Eggs with salmon, potato galette with cream cheese.\
My favourite was the bun with mozzarella and coppa di parma ; incredibly tasty\
and the 3rd and most original was pupkin pancakes with cheese, topped with beets and salad !\

Their juices were really good too ; I tried the refreshing apple, cucumber, lemon shake !\
A must try address, e !ven if to grab a simple coffee.; A lovely place. We stumbled upon it for lunch and for 23 EUR had a 3 course menu with generous portions.

Loved my visit to Ernestine Cafe! The coffee was rich and flavorful, and the pastries were fresh and delicious. The cozy atmosphere and friendly staff make it a perfect place to relax or catch up with friends. Will definitely be back! highly recommend; Was just walking by and decided to give the cafe a chance, I’m so glad I did!\
\
The cozy interior is very charming, they host a lot of children workshops here in a separate playroom open for them to play in while their parents enjoy their meal / drink. There’s a large window looking into the playroom so parents can watch their kids but also have a bit of space to themselves, very family friendly and innovative. The atmosphere is very pleasant and welcoming; there’s mostly locals who stop by here but Ernestine Cafe is also very tourist friendly because the workers speak and understand English well.\
\
The menu is diverse and creative, with all the food being made in house. They have a restroom in the back which makes it convenient to spend some time here. I ordered their brunch and left quiet full and content, will definitely stop by the next time I’m in Paris!; It is a very cosy and charming cafe with a special area for children.

Follow a very good review of Vietnamese community group on Facebook, I gave it a try to support my homeland foods and restaurant owners. I tried their special “Bánh mì chảo” which is kind of double price of a normal bánh mì 8,5€. And that’s already expensive compared to many good banh mì that I have tried in Paris. It was very noisy there and we needed to wait a bit long. And the “Bánh mì chảo” is too far from the bánh mì chảo that I know. Dry, no sauce and quantity is not up to the price 15€. The quality is average. And the bread is under baked, white, too soft not crunchy. I usually don’t spend time to write negative review. I did this time because it isn’t correct to serve average quality for high price.\

The waiter is very friendly. Even though he can barely speak English but still tries to communicate as much as he can. The menu is very simple. You either choose 2 courses pairing the mains with entrees or dessert for 28 Euros or all 3 courses for 36 Euros. All the items in each course is written in French onto the chalkboard. So i presume it is changed regularly. Though I can't understand French,  its easily overcome with Google Lens . The entree of squid and chorizo sausages in an orange thick soup was a pleasant surprise. For the mains I tried beef tatare for the first time and it tastes good. Ended meal with a chocolate mousse with sea salt. The waiter was a one man show handling many tables so each course took some time to arrive which was understandable. Hope the restaurant can find some help soon for this kind gentleman :); Great casual spot.\
Came for a Thursday night dinner. Service was very good and the staff is very nice. The place is quiet and chill and away of the street’s bustle.\
Buratta and the apricot crumble were the highlight of the evening.\
Beef fillet was also good, but nothing too exciting.; We were looking for a fine dine restaurant, this was recommended by our hotel staff, and surprisingly this was indeed a good experience. Price it's reasonable, portions are great, great service! The only improvement I see are the desserts, they are too heavy by my taste, but definitely does not affect overall experience.; The restaurant was an absolutely fantastic discovery having come here for dinner with a friend! We chose it judging by all the positive reviews & we weren't disappointed  Every dish that we ordered was absolutely exquisite!! We had the burrata as a starter, the dorade ceviche as a main and the seasonal crumble, as well S the mousse au chocolat for dessert - each and every one of them was a little wow experience  The prices were fair for the outstanding quality - 27€ for a starter + a main dish or a main dish + a dessert; or 35€ for all the three courses. I had a white wine suggested which fit perfectly with the food and all in all, the service was so warm and welcoming, which is extremely refreshing in the world of grumpy Parisian waiters  The only thing to mention, is that it would be great to have some more qualitative tea instead of just Lipton in a tea bag  It's located in a little hidden street, so it's really calm & away from all the noise of the cars, while being super central, it's simply the perfect mix!!! We will be back for sure & I have already suggested it to other friends ️; It was a nice fixed price menu place. My favorites were the mushroom soup starter and the desserts. For my entrée I had the steak tartare, and I guess it's one of those things I can check off the list as having tried.

I highly recommend this place.; The food was super tasty and the service was very friendly and attentive.; Yes I was an American that went to an American burger place in France... It was one of the few places open and we figured wth. We were so glad we did! Definitely come here! This was probably one of the best burgers I have had in my life! The fries were excellent too. The service is lacking and it seemed like only two people were working and one disappeared and the other had to pick up the slack. We are also still learning how service really works in France so it may have been a cultural disconnect. But even with that, just go you will not be disappointed. I got the mcFly and my sisters got the bacon cheeseburger, do not expect American level bacon, it was still fantastic though. I don't think you could get a bad burger here.","75018","Koff_75018_42","Re-75018","kfgo6075","kfgo6075_43"

The portions are really generous and the service could not be better. A really pleasant surprise,  excellent attention to details and friendly atmosphere. Also very reasonable price, will definitely come back in future visits to Paris, without a doubt; Outstanding small place in the 15th Arr. We had great food starting with roast St Marcelin cheese. Mains were roast Angus beef, crusted chicken and the “family” burger. Each had an outstanding sauce to enhance the flavor. The beef was tender, the chicken moist and the burger was tall and tasty on a brioche. The desserts were a tiramisu of whipped cream, Oreos and raspberries; chocolate lava cake, and sautéed plums. The whipped cream was delicious but the plums were the stand out of the evening, drenched in warm sugar caramel sauce. Great service despite one man handling all duties. Search this place out!!; We stumbled upon this French restaurant by chance, and what a delightful surprise it was! From the moment we walked in, we were warmly welcomed by the lone waiter, who, despite managing all the tables on his own, was incredibly professional and friendly. His attention to detail and kindness really added to our experience\
\
The meal was simply amazing. We started with two appetizers: rillettes and terrine. We loved the option to share these dishes as a family, which made the experience even more enjoyable. Even though we're Irish, we absolutely fell in love with these authentic French flavors\
\
As for the main courses, both the parents and the young adults were equally impressed. The tagine was beautifully aromatic, with perfectly balanced flavors and excellent cooking. The ribs were unbelievably tender, falling off the bone effortlessly, and with an excellent sauce. Every dish we tried was outstanding, prepared with great care and passion i think !!\

Whether you're with friends or family, this is the perfect spot to enjoy authentic cuisine, all complemented by impeccable service, even when the waiter is handling the whole room on his own.

No service thou. You have to make a queue & order & then pick it up. But worth it; We chose this restaurant for its convenience, as options were limited near the Zenith before a show.\
\
The space boasts a spacious, cozy setting with an industrial vibe. However, the service was notably lacking, possibly due to being understaffed on a busy Saturday evening. Our ability to order food was restricted until 7 PM, although our server accommodated us at 6:50 PM. Despite this, our pizza order, even after several reminders, took over 40 minutes, leading us to cancel it. Both the sweet potato and bruschetta entrées were disappointing.\
\
While the ambiance is inviting for drinks, the dining experience was underwhelming. Additionally, seating near the entrance can be uncomfortable in winter, as the cold wind sweeps in each time the door opens.","75019","LaP_75019_19","Re-75019","kfgo6075","kfgo6075_20"

This was down the street and it’s had a few things going for it: an menu that had a few intriguing dishes, a hip looking crowd, and the guy that met me at the door was pretty inviting.\
\
I ended getting a cuttlefish and potato salad with an onion dressing and a vegetarian lasagne. Both dishes really hit it out of the park for me. I’m normally leaning carnivore, but had been overdoing it on the trip so far, and so I was happily surprised that the veg lasagne was possible the best veg one I’ve ever had.\

I was also peaking at the tables by me and the burrata avocado tomato salad also looked great, and the frites looked home made and home style with skins and plenty of dark bits on the edges.","75019","LeH_75019_23","Re-75019","kfgo6075","kfgo6075_24"

The service was friendly and welcoming. Although the booth was quite busy, the staff was professional and courteous. My meal was served in a timely manner, and I appreciated the team's efforts to ensure customers were satisfied.; Very pleasant setting. The kiosk is well placed, and I ate very well. Contrary to what I read in the comments, for my part everything went very well. The waiter who took my order was kind and smiling throughout our exchange. I was served quickly and in a polite manner. I recommend this kiosk.; Very very slow because it is disorganized, the service is shared between the menagerie and the rest of the park. the “fresh daily” bagel bore the date of the day before and was dry and very lightly filled. In short, don't waste your time, go get a salad at the nearby supermarket, it will be better and cheaper.; Opinions are not taken into account but, it is not clean, very long and the only waiter works without health protection...And as a bonus, at 12:45 p.m. there are no more sandwiches...0; To flee. Waffles not made at home, very very expensive, that's why the terrace is empty, the sun is beating down but the young lady closes the parasols under the authority of her manager.\

Otherwise, the food's great, if it ever arrives! ...and it's just steps from the Pantheon. Don't go there hungry!; Great staff here in this lovely surprise restaurant. We had the onion soup, and fish and chips. Both were spot on - the soup was loaded with cheese, steamy hot but not scalding. The fish were nicely battered and cooked properly so not greasy or oily. For once here in Paris, the chips (fries) were still hot. The staff seem run off their feet with the college crowd but they remained friendly and attentive. Overall, this was a nice dinning experience. The younger crowd can get loud and exuberant, so if you want a quiet dinner out, this might not be for you. For us, the staff and the food made up for any noise factor concerns.; Good food, the fries were especially good, fast service and the staff is accommodating to English speakers; My favorite place for a coffee in Paris! I visited a few times during my trip. Their coffee was very good. I tried their cafe frappe and it was great on a hot day. The hot latte was also great. Their mojitos are also nice, they have a happy hour! I also tried their burger, it was very good and a big portion. The atmosphere is amazing, the outside seating area is lovely, very quiet, no noise from the street. The staff was nice and friendly.; The food was extremely delicious.

To top off a great dinner he treated us to mint shots that we loved. Give this place a try!; We decided to try this place out after seeing all the fantastic reviews, but upon arrival, we almost thought we were at the wrong place—it looked almost like a PMU from the outside!

\
There's even a piano set up for their piano nights, adding a charming touch. The staff was incredibly friendly, which made our experience even better.\
The food? Absolutely delightful. I had the foie gras and salade périgourdine as starters, which were hearty enough to be mains, followed by the succulent souris d’agneau. The portions were generous across the board, definitely making it worth the money.\

I would heartily recommend this spot and affirm that it truly deserves its high ratings, especially for the quality of the cuisine.; Amazing little gem. Very good food.

The restaurant is really compact and space is scarce to move around. The service is very good, attentive, helpful and prompt. The five stars are for the great service really and not so much for the food - I have had better. Reservations are required in advance as it gets busy. It seems overpriced to me.; Our second time in Les Enfants Rouges was interesting. Definitely reserve your table in advance, the place is packed. Cozy atmosphere. Staff is super nice. Best dish-desert. Both Pavlova and Cheese cake were superb. Lamb chops were delicious. Neither of the entries deserve a mention, thus 4 stars.; Definitely a 5-star and particularly at the reasonable price. Dishes from Les Enfants Rouge and chef-patron Daï Shinozuka. He takes classic French ingredients and adds Japanese flair. Each dish worked well with balanced, nuanced flavours that excited the palate. The rum baba is the best in the world. With one bottle of wine, the cost was just under €100 a head.\
The first time we came was about ten years ago. Standards have not dropped and its popularity is understandable - so book in advance. Five stars! (And the service was good too.); A must stop by place if you’re in Paris. Modern French cuisine, with a Japanese twist. Everything was absolutely delicious, and the dishes were art pieces. Very friendly staff and cozy atmosphere. Reservation recommended! Great selection of drinks including Japanese cocktails and sake ; Blown away by the quality of the lunch course, especially compared to the price. This place at least deserves a bib gourmand imho.

But the real star of the show here is the burgers. They are simply outstanding. The patties are juicy and flavorful, cooked to perfection with just the right amount of seasoning. The buns are soft and pillowy, providing the perfect base for the toppings, which are fresh and high-quality.\
Also my 3yo loves to eat there ️; Favorite place. We go there every week end. Few people know that but they added Tacos at the menu and they are just amazing and so healthy. Burgers are the best in town and salads are perfect too.; The place is located in one of the coolest areas!!\
We were able to book the table inside but at the Terrace.. so in between and it was the best choice!!\
The owner and the servers greeted us with big smiles and showed us our tables!!\
They suggested to order three different entrees as all of them had great taste!!!\
After that we ordered the main dish, burger!!\
On great thing was they had vegetarian burger and they also had beyond meat options!!\
The size of the burger is perfect and its very well made!! The burger and the entree were accompanied by a bio wine which was super good in taste and perfectly going well with the burger!!\
In the end we ordered desserts, which again surpassed our expectations!!\
The owner was so nice that he offered some fries and a glass of champagne!!\

Coffee, really not good at all. I had a coffee earlier the day at the excellent Casa (specialty coffee Paris XII).\

They have coffee, tea, snacks for kids as well as a great play area with lots of toys and books. They allow laptops as well so I got to get some work done while my family played in the play area. And Ines was really kind as well!; Great little place to come pass an hour or two, with or without kids! The cafe is clean and has a great energy; friendly, welcoming, come-as-you-are vibe. There are so many events for kids and families in their two rooms in the back and downstairs, plus the space in general is made for little ones running around. Can't wait to come back!; Such a great spot for families! We’re lucky we live steps away as we just had a baby. The owners are so lovely, the coffee & sweets are delicious, and their activities, like yoga, are so great to have in the neighbourhood.; came here as I was looking for a place to let my 11 month old baby have a safe space to roam while this mum gets to drink a warm cup of coffee. Super good atmosphere, quite a good selection of toys to play with, toilet is clean as well. Felt really safe to let my child play here, owners are super friendly as well! Definitely will be back again; Great little place, we had some time to kill before our eurostar train and this was conveniently located. The menu isn't very large (sweets only) but what we tried was very good (matcha white chocolate cookie and chocolate hazelnut cookie). Prices a little steep - 5 euros for very small latte, 4 euros cookie each but I guess you are also paying for the playarea. It felt a little cold inside too.","75009","Trib_75009_32","Co-75009","kfgo6075","kfgo6075_33"

Yummy and looks so pretty. We were well received and served with a smile (so important in Paris right ? )\
It’s a little more expensive than we thought but you get what you pay for. Around 18€ for a main. We shared pancakes after so it came out to about 28€ pp for a drink a main and a shared dessert.\
Toilets clean, coffee is pretty good, I got a very original drawing on line which made me very happy !; Absolutely amazing brunch spot! We went here every day during our trip in Paris because it was so good. The staff was so kind and friendly to us, especially the server (wish we had asked her name). Highly recommend the eggs Benedict, purple pancakes, and purple french toast. If you want to avoid waiting, go on weekdays or get there when they open on weekends. We loved it!; Best impressions! Food is always delicious, my favorite place for brunch dishes in Paris! Located in the great spot as well! The service is very kind and friendly. Thank you for your always welcoming attitude and honesty.; Food was excellent! Everything that we tried was tasty. Portions were big. Staff was friendly and helpful. But it was 26 degrees outside, you can sit only inside and it was too hot.\
All in all it was a very pleasant experience! Thank you!; Me and my friend had the purple french toast, which was amazing!! She already had it before and had to come back to get it.\
\
Also the staff were so lovely and gave us great tips for Paris as a first-timer ","75004","Wond_75004_58","Re-75004","kfgo6075","kfgo6075_59"

The drinks were are standouts and very refreshing.   It was easy to enjoy our conversation and our food.  I highly recommend the cucumber gazpacho.   Excellent!  We ordered different dishes and enjoyed them immensely.  Thank you for a fresh and delicious meal! I’d definitely come again.; Given the many choices Paris offers concerning places to eat dinner, choosing the place to settle can be quite the challenge. Luckily the Fork helped us out with an amazing deal. At first caution is advised when deals seem too good to be true, however, we were pleasantly surprised by the food, atmosphere and charming server (and probably owner). In regards to the actual dinner, the food consisted of classics presented in a modern way whilst also offering some newer dishes. Luckily this restaurant understood the importance of A-grade ingredients as simple recipes were very tasteful. Given the size of Paris, accessibility is very important as well. Given that there is a metro station just across the street, reaching Yuman should give little issues even when situated in the centre like we were. In our eyes, the owner and staff of Yuman understood the message of what good food and service meant and thus we could absolutely recommend this restaurant!; As someone who isn't really into vegan and organic restaurants, I gotta say I really loved the food here, good portions and the price was reasonable; Very healthy and tasty food. They use only biological ingredients. I find their prices are quite expensive compared to other places I know.; Very nice place, with stunning atmosphere and decoration. Super nice staff, that chatted with us and answered our million questions!\
Great place, both for the organic food and suitable aura.","75013","YUMA_75013_45","Re-75013","kfgo6075","kfgo6075_46"
