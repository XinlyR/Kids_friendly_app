There is a loft. WiFi, outlets, and A/C are all there! Some other customers were occupying more tables than they needed and the staff didn't care, which could be good and bad...üòÖ"", 'The experience with the Chemex was disappointing. The coffee was clearly under-extracted, compromising the flavor. The service was also lacking; the barista who prepared my coffee did not demonstrate any knowledge about the bean used. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this place.', 'Cool coffee shop with great vibes and decent coffee.\n\nI only stopped by to grab a quick espresso to go but thought the vibe and decor were nice. Also like that they have a brew bar, even though I didn‚Äôt try it.\n\nThe house blend espresso was not good. It was I‚Äôve extracted.

Prufrock Coffee,4.5,1875,"['Beautiful coffees! We went there a couple times for coffee, brunch, and pastries during the time we were in London.

The service was excellent even if the shop was almost all the time full.

In comparison to other 15 coffee shops we went to in those two weeks, Prufrocks still stays on top. I would give you guys 6 stars for costumer service if I could. Our waiter, who's name was Charlie, was extremely nice. Always asking is everything okay, do we need anything else, refilling out waters every time he passed by our table. Even though we only came to get a cup of coffee, we felt like at a 5 star restaurant.\n\nMy friend said that her latte was very balanced and nice.\nMy filter coffee was amazing too. Very strong flavour, had no bitterness, was very fruity and had floral notes too.\n\nThe coffee shop itself has very pretty decor too, instrustial mixed with retro, but giving of very warm atmosphere. The dark turquoise tiled bar was one of out favourite things üòç.\n\nAgain thank you guys so much for the amazing coffee and the service, if we're ever back in the UK, we'll be sure to come again!"", 'Prufrock is one of my absolute favorite cafes in the world.

One thing that I think sets Prufrock apart - aside from the incredible quality - is the VARIETY.\n‚Ä¢ You can enjoy so many different coffees here on any given day. Ranging from their espresso blends or single origin; they usually always have 3 different filter coffees available at different price points, along with a decaf option.\n‚Ä¢ They‚Äôll often also have something you can sample on batch brew.\n‚Ä¢ I do wish there was a batch brew option that I could simply purchase to bring the cost down when coming regularly.\n‚Ä¢ Also for retail, there variety is even greater. Coming here is a great way to discover new roasters and coffees!\n\nFood\n‚Ä¢ The food is excellent! I‚Äôve tried the ‚ÄúBenny‚Äù (Eggs Benedict) with the bacon and salmon - both are absolutely to die for. I‚Äôve also had their toast which is very nice.\n‚Ä¢ Pastries are incredible! The cinnamon buns are just ridiculous ü§§ The almond croissants are beautifully done. I‚Äôm a big fan of Kouign-amanns and it‚Äôs lovely to see them sold here!\n\nAtmosphere & Interior\n‚Ä¢ I just love the interior design and overall vibe here. There is a nice variety of tables, ranging from window bars, high tables, single tables, and a couple of large booths.\n‚Ä¢ The bathroom is nice, clean, and pleasant.\n‚Ä¢ It does get busy but they have a nice system where the staff will seat you and they do a great job of keeping things in order.\n‚Ä¢ Note that there is no Wi-Fi and for me with EE there is pretty poor service. But they do allow people to work from the cafe which is nice ‚ú®\n\nPrice\n‚Ä¢ There‚Äôs no question that things are a bit pricey. But I think this is a place that doesn‚Äôt hide that and you know you‚Äôre getting what you pay for.\n‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs not just about the quality of the coffee and food, it‚Äôs also the table service and very well coordinated system they have. It‚Äôs how they handle your ordering and paying experience very smoothly. It‚Äôs how kind, friendly, knowledgeable, and well-trained all the staff are.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, my only wish regarding price was having a batch brew on sale and perhaps even a special refill price for batch brew.\n\nOverall I just love this place and all the people who make it what it is. Thank you Prufrock! ‚ù§Ô∏è']"

Before paying, the barista asked if I wanted anything else (i.e. a snack), and I inquired if anything was gluten free. In response, they scoffed and went ""Do you see this see this? We don\'t have the space for something like that."" I was a bit taken back, to be honest. A simple \'no\' would have been fine. I don\'t expect every place to have gluten free options, but I do expect to be treated with respect. Perhaps that particular barista was not having a good day, but it certainly wasn\'t what I was expecting.\n\nThe coffee was good, but not great. I would say it\'s typical standard of what you\'d expect at a London coffee shop.\n\nBesides the patio, there aren\'t many seating options. It\'s more of a takeout, rather than dine-in, spot.\n\nThere are other coffee shops in the area with friendlier service that I would frequent before this one.', 'Great coffee (it was even free when we were there as they celebrated 15 years of their store) but it was so great I had to donate to their cause of bringing great coffee to London.\nGreat cold brew and nice selection of specialty coffees.\nIncredibly friendly service that took their time explaining their different coffees and recommended brewing temperatures, that‚Äôs the kind of service and knowledge you are looking forward to when going for great coffee!', 'Finally some decent coffee I had in awhile.

They opened a few years ago and looked like the quirky outsider in a high street awash with cookie-cutter coffee offerings from Starbucks, Costa, Nero et al. They still look a bit quirky - and their coffee is far superior than the aforementioned - but they have expanded globally. Good for them. But the artisan look is a facade. We dropped into the Bankside branch for a light breakfast. You used to order at the counter and chat to the server but now they‚Äôve installed a touch-screen system. Like McD‚Äôs. The servers were friendly btw. We ordered a sausage bap and a cheese and ham toastie. Clearly reheated, pre-cooked - not the perceived artisanal food you might expect from little old Black Sheep ‚Äòkeeping it real‚Äô.

ARRO Coffee - Bayswater,4.4,1078,"['Arro Coffee has written on top of their entrance in big white letters Specialty Coffee. Now, I work at a specialty coffee shop so let me tell you what disappointed me. The first strike was the cold brew; besides the fact none of the baristas knew what bean it was made of they also shrugged me off like I was bothering them when I asked. When I tried the cold brew though, the disappointment was the worst. Never have I ever thrown out a full cup of coffee to trash right away but I also trained my palate and this cold brew was just so so so old and it tasted like the ratio between coffee and water was off.  It was just really not good coffee and it was sad for a coffee shop advertising they sell and brew specialty coffee. The baristas had absolutely no idea about any of the beans on sale or on daily filters. The atmosphere inside was nice and the pastries looked literally better than the coffee. Get the croissants, I‚Äôm sad I didn‚Äôt. So for anyone who is not picky about their coffee, this might be the place to go. For someone who makes an experience of it, not so much.

Flat White,4.4,1017,"[""In response to Jemma‚Äôs review‚Ä¶\n\nFirst off, Flat White is not a co-working space for people to use freely.

The vibe at Flat White is centred around playing music that appeals to regulars like myself‚Äîpeople who come here to relax, enjoy good coffee, and soak in the atmosphere. Asking them to turn down the music goes against what the caf√© is all about. If that's not your style, there are plenty of alternatives, such as Starbucks or other places that might better suit your preferences.\n\nAs a regular, I‚Äôve always found the staff to be friendly and accommodating, which is one of the reasons I come back. Given my experience, it‚Äôs hard to believe the staff were rude to you unless something from your end contributed to that.\n\nIn short, not every place is obligated to cater to individual tastes.

The broccoli was seared, not charred? Small point, big difference in the flavour stakes. The avocado was good, which a local tells me is as rare as chervil. Fennel fronds aren't as pretty, but perhaps make the twist they're aiming for. The dressings could be more positive too. Overall though, it's a pleasant enough item...if pleasant enough is what you're up for. The pumpkin spice cake follows suit. A well thought theough and constructed surprisingly light frosting sits on top of a somewhat spiced cake that needs to be more about the butter.

I was rudely told that is impossible and I have to order from one of the clerks when they go upstairs - even though there was no one serving upstairs because the store was so busy. So forced to choose between waiting upstairs probably for another 20 minutes until someone goes up or getting take out, I choose take out. I was immediately told that if I get the parties to go I cannot go upstairs to eat them or use the tables outside. Yes, that is what getting something to go means, but I just smile and place my order. Then I'm told that credit cards require a 30 dollar minimum purchase. The small sign is only posted at the checkout register. No problem, I just ask for another pastry and some macaroons. I get attitude in return. I've never seen such disrespectful service from a cafe or patisserie, and I buy a lot of pastries. If a store wants to charge people more for wanting to eat on premises, let them charge more. I have no problem paying for the forks, napkins, and dish cleaning that is required. But don't give me attitude for trying to be helpful by offering to carry my own food upstairs when I clearly see that you are busy handling customers diastasis and have trouble keeping track of who is in line and who is skipping the line.

The espresso had a sour, acidic taste, which I'm not a fan of. Unsure if the beans were under-roasted or stale.

You give your order right as you enter, in front of the stacked cups. I always feel like the barista can't see me (blocked line of sight for shorter people). Then when you get to the open-spaced cashier don't forget to look down, into the case, for the yummy gluten pastries. To be fair I did try the gluten-free apple donut since it sat prominently on the counter. But the chewy-yet-fluffy cinnamon sugar mochi donut is my preference!! Moonrise Bakery did it right! The coffee bean is BOLD, but not too acidic (commonly mistaken for bitter). You can adjust it (Americano), or add your milk. Another weird/tight flow issue is that the lid/milk station is further inside the shop, toward the back. So if there are more than a few customers there might be some elbow rubbing & bumping. But if you love their coffee bean then I guess you can put up with it. As for me, if it's too busy I'll just wait until next time. They do have some other coffee-making related supplies,including whole bean, for sale. And a local chocolate company's dark chovolate bars for sale (I'll update the brand when I remember).

Train your baristas on better customer service, if someone comes in to get their drink remade because they didn‚Äôt like one of their drinks they just ordered, don‚Äôt ask them to go wait in the long line again.

She was not friendly at all and had some attitude towards customer.

I was standing and waiting and even complaining but she totally ignored and never said sorry. It began with how much I tipped her. She was standing and watching how much I put as a tip.\n\nIf you want to get your coffee faster here, I strongly suggest leave large tips then you can skip the line and get the better service.']"

In the evening it isn't super busy but I think the place would have nice ambiance when it is. It also seems like a great spot to study or meet up with friends."", 'Very cool coffee shop. The shop has a modern interior design, plenty of space inside and in the Troy block.  I like the selection of coffee and pastries.\nThis time, I ordered a seasonal latte, and was unhappy because the coffee was too sweet.  I wish there was an option to adjust the sweetness as for $8 I expect a quality drink.', 'I used Toast to pre-order a cold brew and a breakfast sandwich. They were out of the flavouring I requested in the cold brew, and the barista was very polite about that. However, they handed me the sandwich cold‚Äîand, after eating it, I noticed the ‚Äúbest before‚Äù date was several days ago. I know the ‚Äúbest before‚Äù date doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs expired but if I‚Äôm paying full price, I‚Äôd expect this not to happen.', 'Great atmosphere. Good for an afternoon of remote work. My first impression of the coffee was the foam which was low end for the price I paid (5.50 for 6oz cappuccino). The coffee itself was well roasted with some beautiful fruity notes without a hint of bitterness. However, for my palette it was too sour. I prefer a more balanced cup. But if you like quite sour coffees then you will really enjoy.', 'House cold brew is fine, but there are way too much ice in the cup, still it tastes good.\nThe almond croissant is almost garbage, tasting stale as if it has been there for a week. The fluffy and soft taste is never there.\nCozy seating with spacious seat arrangement.']"

Bagged coffee beans were ground fresh upon arrival. Delightful.', 'Warm, friendly space and great coffee!\nHighly recommend the cardamom latte and cardamom matcha.', 'Coffee was good. Service was complicated. Inside was spacious. Outside was a bit uncomfortable with a person lurking at the door, cool graffiti around though.', 'Best tasting coffees! Pro tip: if you like a mocha, try their Medici. Doesn‚Äôt get any better than that. Pastries are all really good too and the Staffs super nice. Cozy inside with a few spots to work and then during the summer they have a few outside tables.']"

They offer some pastries and Saunt sandwiches to go with a wide variety of coffees and drinks. The place is nice and clean and the staff is good. The man running the place was keeping it orderly and making sure. Thanks for running smoothly. I ordered the honey fig latte and it was pretty good, although I‚Äôll probably try something next time. The turkey and cheese croissant was delicious, although very thin.', 'Finding good drip coffee is difficult but you will get it here.

Never had such a tasty muffin before. I tried the cappuccino al Cacao - which is cappuccino with chocolate. It was decent. Overall would come back to this place to try more on their menu. Go local and support places like these.\n\nPS- for the first time I saw a menu being displayed by a projector. This felt like an innovative way of using a projector! Great job to whoever thought about this', 'Very nice coffe place owned by an italian. He is very friendly and the coffee quite good.

Comfort with a vegetable grilled cheese, Fresh made Nutella twist, and brisk coffees.', 'Bequest has the BEST seasonal drinks! I‚Äôve yet to have a bad flavor.

The year-round house specials are amazing too; the Maple Blondie is my go-to and I highly recommend it!', 'Great, down to earth, vibes. Super friendly service. There are plenty of tables inside and I get the impression it would be a great place to both set up a laptop to work, or have a conversation with a date or a friend.

It has a lot of paintings and collectibles from local artists on display for sale. It has many books to read, a lot of board games and also a lot of star wars memorabilia on display. We got a drip and an inigo montoya. Both the drinks were excellent and sharp. Absolutely worth a visit.', 'Delicious, fresh, piping hot breakfast sandwiches. ü§§ Lovely cafe theme and atmosphere. Update, took a star off. I still love their vibe but they don‚Äôt make the egg breakfast sandwiches the same, it‚Äôs not them freshly mixing eggs and cooking it anymore. It‚Äôs a square mixed egg that have a totally different taste and consistency. That was my main reason for going so I‚Äôll just be there for tea and vibes :/']"

I‚Äôm  big on customer service and immediately upon walking in I was greeted with a smile from the barista at the register. A plus in my book! I was happy to see they have nitro cold brew, so that‚Äôs what I order + a homer donut. The donut was amazing, soft buttery and fluffy. The atmosphere is chill with a nice layout, very clean.
